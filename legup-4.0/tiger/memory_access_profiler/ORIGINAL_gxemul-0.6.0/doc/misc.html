<h3>Writing operating system code, or developing firmware, using GXemul:</h3>

Is this a good idea?  The answer is yes and no, depending on the level of
detail you need in your simulations. If you are developing an operating
system or operating system kernel of your own, then the emulator can be a 
complement to testing on real hardware.

<p>Important things to keep in mind:

<ul>
	<li>Porting code to a specific machine mode, e.g. a Silicon Graphics
	machine, using GXemul, will not "magically" cause the code to
	work on a real machine. Sometimes code works in GXemul which doesn't
	work on real hardware, sometimes it's the other way around.

	<p>
	<li>GXemul contains bugs, and many things are not yet implemented.

	<p>
	<li><b>Very important!</b> I have only implemented devices in GXemul
	to the degree that NetBSD, OpenBSD, Linux, etc don't complain too much.
	<p>
	If you are developing a driver for a device which is emulated by
	GXemul, and your driver does not seem to be working, then the
	probability of a bug in GXemul's implementation of the device is
	very much higher than that of a bug in your driver.
	<p>
	The device implementations in GXemul are based on the assumption
	that the emulated OS is already developed and bug-free. They are
	not primarily intended to be used for development of new device
	driver code in operating systems, so if you do that, then be
	prepared for bugs and inconsitencies.
	<p>
	<li>CPU details in GXemul are usually wrong. If your code depends
	on, say, R10000 or MIPS64 specifics, chances are that GXemul will
	not be sufficient. One example is different revisions of ISAs;
	some instructions which should trigger an exception on a
	real MIPS processor usually execute anyway in GXemul. Another
	example is if userland code tries to access kernel memory; in some
	cases there is protection against this, but not in all cases (to get
	higher performance).
	<p>
	<li>Caches. There is no cache emulation in GXemul right now. Caches
	for R2000/R3000 are faked well enough to run NetBSD, Ultrix, etc
	in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECstation">DECstation</a>
	emulation mode, but other than that, cache operations are treated as nops.
</ul>

<p>The bottom line is that GXemul can be useful as yet another way to test 
your code during development, but it should not be fully relied on.






<p><br>
<a name="compilercontruct"></a>
<h3>Using GXemul in compiler contruction courses:</h3>

If you are learning how to write a compiler, and wish to target a 
realistic target platform, then MIPS or ARM (as emulated by GXemul)
might be suitable choices.

<ul>
  <li><b>(+)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your compiler needs to output real assembly
	language code, which the assembler (e.g. gas, the GNU assembler) can 
	then compile into object format, and then you need to link this
	into an executable image. This is much closer to how things work
	in real life than running assembly language listings in a simulator
	(e.g. <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~larus/spim.html">SPIM</a>).
  <p>
  <li><b>(-)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;GXemul does not simulate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-order_execution">out-of-order
	execution</a>, penalties related to instruction scheduling, or
	load-delays, so it cannot be used to create optimizing compilers
	that take advantage of such processor features. GXemul keeps
	track of the number of instructions executed, and that's it.
</ul>

<a name="disk"></a>
<h3>How to start the emulator with a disk image:</h3>

Add <i>-d [prefixes:]diskimagefilename</i> to the command line, where prefixes
are one or more single-character options. Run <b>gxemul -h</b>
to get a list of possible options.

<p>
Here are some examples. If you want to run a <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/ports/pmax/">NetBSD/pmax</a>
kernel on an emulated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECstation">DECstation</a>
machine, you would use a command line such as this:
<pre>
	$ <b>gxemul -e 3max -d pmax_diskimage.fs netbsd-pmax-INSTALL</b>
</pre>

<p>NOTE: For some emulation modes, such as the DECstation mode, you do 
<i>not</i> actually have to specify the name of the kernel, if the disk 
image is bootable!

<p>It is possible to have more than one disk. For each -d argument, a disk
image is added; the first will be SCSI target 0, the second will be target 1, and so on,
unless you specify explicitly which ID number the devices should have.
<pre>
	$ <b>gxemul -e 3max -d disk0.raw -d disk1.raw -d 5:disk2.raw netbsd-pmax-INSTALL</b>
</pre>
Note: In the example above, disk2.raw will get scsi id 5.

<p>If a filename has a 'c' prefix, or ends with ".iso", then it is assumed to be
a CDROM device (this can be overridden with a 'd' prefix, to force a read/write disk).
For example, the following command would start the emulator with two
CDROM images, and one harddisk image:
<pre>
	$ <b>gxemul -e 3max -d image.iso -d disk0.img -d c:second_cdrom.img netbsd-pmax-INSTALL</b>
</pre>
Usually, the device with the lowest id becomes the boot device. To override
this, add a 'b' prefix to one of the devices:
<pre>
	$ <b>gxemul -e 3max -d rootdisk.img -d bc:install-cd.iso name_of_kernel</b>
</pre>
If you have a physical CD-ROM drive on the host machine, say /dev/cd0c, you can
use it as a CD-ROM directly accessible from within the emulator:
<pre>
	$ <b>gxemul -e 3max -d rootdisk.img -d bc:/dev/cd0c name_of_kernel</b>
</pre>
It is probably possible to use harddisks as well this way, but I would not
recommend it.






<p><br>
<a name="tape_images"></a>
<h3>How to start the emulator with tape images:</h3>

Using emulated tape drives is a bit more complicated than disks, because a
tape can be made up of several "files" with space in between. The solution
I have choosen is to have one file in the host's file system space for each
tape file. The prefix for using tapes is 't', and the filename given is
for the <i>first</i> file on that tape (number zero, implicitly). For
files following file nr 0, a dot and the filenumber is appended to the
filename.
<p>
As an example, starting the emulator with
<pre>
	<b>-d t4:mytape.img</b>
</pre>
will cause SCSI id 4 to be a tape device, using the following file number
to name translation scheme:
<p>
<center>
 <table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td><b>File number:</b></td>
    <td><b>File name in the host's filesystem:</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">0</td>
    <td align="left">mytape.img</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">1</td>
    <td align="left">mytape.img.1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">2</td>
    <td align="left">mytape.img.2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">..</td>
    <td align="left">..</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
</center>
<p>
If you already have a number of tape files, which should be placed on the
same emulated tape, then you might not want to rename all those files.
Use symbolic links instead (ln -s).
<p>
There is another advantage to using symbolic links for tape filenames:
every time a tape is rewound, it is reopened using the filename given
on the command line. By changing what the symbolic name points to,
you can "switch tapes" without quiting and restarting the emulator.

<p>
<font color="#ff0000">Note: Tape support is most likely very buggy, 
because it has not been tested much, and has probably also suffered 
from bit-rot by now.</font>






<p><br>
<a name="disk_overlays"></a>
<h3>How to use disk image overlays:</h3>

This is most likely best understood by an example:

<p><ul>
  <li>Install e.g. <a href="guestoses.html#netbsdcatsinstall">NetBSD/cats</a>.
	You will end up with a disk image called
	<tt>nbsd_cats.img</tt>.
  <p>
  <li>Running the following command will boot straight from the disk
	image, with no overlay images:<pre>
	<b>gxemul -XEcats -d nbsd_cats.img netbsd.aout-GENERIC.gz</b>

</pre>
  <li>You may now create an overlay file, a corresponding map file,
	and start the emulator with the overlay image connected to
	the same (explicit) ID as the base disk image:<pre>
	<b>touch overlay.img overlay.img.map
	gxemul -XEcats -d 0:nbsd_cats.img -d V0:overlay.img netbsd.aout-GENERIC.gz</b>

</pre>
  <li>Any changes to the filesystem you perform when using the overlay
	will only be written to that overlay. For example, to perform
	a "roll back", you can do the following:<pre>
	<b>rm -f overlay.img overlay.img.map
	touch overlay.img overlay.img.map</b>

</pre>
	and then simply start the emulator again, with the newly created
	overlay image.
</ul>

<p>It is also possible to add multiple overlays. In that case, writes 
always go the the <i>last</i> added overlay.

<p>GXemul uses Unix' way of supporting files with "holes",
so even if <tt>ls -l overlay.img</tt> says that the overlay is several 
gigabytes large, <tt>du overlay.img</tt> should reveal that only the
blocks that have actually been written to have been stored in the
overlay, e.g.:<pre>
	<b>$ ls -l
	..
	-rw-r--r--  1 debug  wheel  3072319488 Mar 24 11:59 nbsd_cats.img
	-rw-r--r--  1 debug  wheel     2465354 Mar 24 11:44 netbsd.aout-GENERIC.gz
	-rw-r--r--  1 debug  wheel  2930841600 Mar 24 14:02 overlay.img
	-rw-r--r--  1 debug  wheel      715538 Mar 24 14:02 overlay.img.map
	$ du overlay.img
	864     overlay.img
</b>
</pre>

<p>The .map file is simply a raw bitmap telling which blocks of the 
overlay file that are in use.





<p><br>
<a name="filexfer"></a>
<h3>Transfering files to/from the guest OS:</h3>

If the emulated machine supports networking (see <a 
href="networking.html#intro">this section</a> for more info), then the easiest
way to transfer files is probably to use FTP or similar methods.

<p>There is another way of transfering files which works for any kind of 
emulated machine which supports disks (either SCSI or IDE). Any file can 
be supplied as a disk image. For example, consider the following:<pre>
	$ <b>gxemul -XEcats -d nbsd_cats.img -d archive.tar.gz netbsd-GENERIC</b>
</pre>
This will start NetBSD/cats with <tt>nbsd_cats.img</tt> as IDE master on
controller 0 (wd0), and <tt>archive.tar.gz</tt> as IDE slave on controller
0 (wd1). From inside NetBSD, it is now possible to extract the files using 
the following command:<pre>
	(inside emulated NetBSD/cats)
	# <b>tar zxvf /dev/wd1c</b>
</pre>
Don't worry if NetBSD complains about lack of disklabel; it doesn't
matter. On some machines, NetBSD uses <tt>wd1d</tt> instead of 
<tt>wd1c</tt> for the entire disk.
There is also a minor problem: reading the end of the disk image. If you 
experience problems untaring archives like this, then pad out the archive 
first with some zeroes.

<p>Transfering files <i>out</i> from the emulated operating system to the 
host can be done the same way. First, prepare an empty archive file:<pre>
	$ <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=newarchive.tar bs=1024 count=1 seek=10000</b>
</pre>This example created a 10 MB empty file. Then, start the emulator
like this:<pre>
	$ <b>gxemul -XEcats -d nbsd_cats.img -d archive.tar netbsd-GENERIC</b>
</pre>
and transfer files by creating an archive directly onto the disk image:<pre>
	(inside emulated NetBSD/cats)
	# <b>tar cvf /dev/wd1c filenames</b>
</pre>
where filenames are the files or directories to transfer.





<p><br>
<a name="largeimages"></a>
<h3>How to extract large gzipped disk images:</h3>

Unix filesystems usually support large files with "holes". Holes are 
zero-filled blocks that don't actually exist on disk. This is very 
practical for emulated disk images, as it is possible to create a very 
large disk image without using up much space at all.

<p>
Using gzip and gunzip on disk images can be <i>very</i> slow, as these 
files can be multiple gigabytes large, but this is usually necessary for
transfering disk images over the internet. If you receive a gzipped disk 
image, say disk.img.gz, and run a naive
<p>
<pre>
	$ <b>gunzip disk.img.gz</b>
</pre>
<p>
on it, you will not end up with an optimized file unless 
gunzip supports that. (In my experiments, it doesn't.)  In plain English, 
if you type <b>ls -l</b> and the filesize is 9 GB, it will actually occupy 
9 GB of disk space! This is often unacceptable.
<p>
Using a simple tool which only writes blocks that are non-zero, a lot of 
space can be saved. Compile the program cp_removeblocks in the 
experiments/ directory, and type:
<p>
<pre>
	$ <b>gunzip -c disk.img.gz | cp_removeblocks /dev/stdin disk.img</b>
</pre>

<p>
This will give you a disk.img which looks like it is 9 GB, and works like
the real file, but the holes are not written out to the disk. (You can see
this by running for example <b>du disk.img</b> to see the physical block
count.)






<p><br>
<a name="promdump"></a>
<h3>Using a PROM dump from a real machine:</h3>

Raw PROM images from real machines can, in a few cases, be used in
the emulator. ROM code is usually much more sensitive to correctness
of the emulator than operating system kernels or userland programs
are, so don't expect any PROM image to just magically work.


<p>
<h4>Dumping the PROM on a DECstation 5000/125:</h4>

The image first needs to be extracted from the machine. There are
several ways to do this.

<ul>
  <li>Use hardware to read the PROM chip(s) directly. Not easy if you
	don't have such a hardware reader.
  <li>Copy the PROM memory range into a file, from a running
	operating system. You need a running OS, and it must
	have access to the PROM memory range. NetBSD, for example,
	doesn't allow that from userland.
  <li>Hook up a serial console and dump using the PROM's own dump
	command.
</ul>

<p>The easiest way is to hook up a serial console. The terminal must be
able to capture output to a file.

<p>These are approximately the commands that I used:
<pre>
        >><b>cnfg</b>                             <i>Show machine configuration</i>

        >><b>printenv</b>                         <i>Show environment variables</i>

        >><b>setenv more 0</b>                    <i>This turns off the More messages</i>

        >><b>e -x 0xbfc00000:0xbfffffff</b>       <i>Dump the PROM data</i>
</pre>

<p>Remember that DECstations are little endian, so if the dump data
looks like this:
<pre>
        bfc00000:  0x0bf0007e
</pre>
then the bytes in memory are actually 0x7e, 0x00, 0xf0, and 0x0b.

<p>At 9600 bps, about 10KB can be dumped per minute, so it takes a while.
Once enough of the PROM has been dumped, you can press CTRL-C to break out.
Then, restore the more environment variable:
<pre>
        >><b>setenv more 24</b>
</pre>

<p>Now, convert the data you just saved (little-endian words -> bytes),
and store in a file. Let's call this file DECstation5000_125_promdump.bin.
<pre>
        $ <b>decprom_dump_txt_to_bin DECstation5000_125_promdump.txt DECstation5000_125_promdump.bin</b>
</pre>

This binary image can now be used in the emulator:
<pre>
	$ <b>gxemul -e 3min -Q -M128 -q 0xbfc00000:DECstation5000_125_promdump.bin</b>

	KN02-BA V5.7e

	 boot=

	 haltaction=h
	 more=24
	 #=3
	 console=*
	 osconsole=3
	>>
</pre>

<p><font color="#ff0000">(Note: at the moment, this doesn't work.
I must have broken something when fixing something else, but this
is what it looked like at the time.)</font>

<p>During bootup, the PROM complains <i>a lot</i> about hardware failures.
That's because the emulator doesn't emulate the hardware well enough yet.

<p>The command line options used are: <tt>-e 3min</tt> for
"DECstation 3min" (5000/1xx), <tt>-Q</tt> to supress the emulator's own PROM
call emulation, <tt>-M128</tt> for 128MB RAM (because GXemul doesn't correctly
emulate memory detection well enough for the PROM to accept, so it will
always believe there is 128MB ram anyway), and <tt>-q</tt> to supress debug messages.
The <tt>0xbfc00000</tt> in front of the filename tells GXemul that it is a raw
binary file which should be loaded at a specific virtual address.
