<h1>Release notes for GXemul 0.6.0</h1>

<p><i>Copyright (C) 2003-2010  Anders Gavare</i>

<p><br>GXemul is a framework for full-system computer architecture emulation. 
Several processor architectures and machine types have been implemented. 
It is working well enough to allow <a href="guestoses.html">unmodified
"guest" operating systems to run inside the emulator</a>,
as if they were running on real hardware.

<p>The emulator emulates (networks of) real machines. The machines may consist
of ARM, MIPS, Motorola 88K, PowerPC, and SuperH processors, and various 
surrounding hardware components such as framebuffers, busses, interrupt 
controllers, ethernet controllers, disk controllers, and serial port 
controllers.

<p>The <a href="index.html">documentation</a> lists the machines and
guest operating systems that 
can be regarded as "working" in GXemul. The best working guest operating 
system is <a href="guestoses.html#netbsdpmaxinstall">NetBSD/pmax</a>.


<p><br>The main change between release 0.4.7.2 and 0.6.0 is:

<ul>
  <li>Since late 2007, a complete rewrite of the emulator's base framework
  	has been going on. GXemul 0.6.0 is a <b><i>very early release</i></b>
  	of the new framework. So far, <i><b>only the
	<a href="machines/machine_testm88k.html">testm88k</a> machine mode</i></b>
	has been rewritten to use the new framework, all other machine modes
	run in legacy mode using the old framework (which is still included).

	<p>In other words: <b>For most emulation modes, 0.6.0 will be
	exactly like 0.4.7.2.</b>

	<p>The new <tt>testm88k</tt> mode is much less complete than the old
	<tt>testm88k</tt>; the reason for concentrating on this mode is to be able
	to make an initial release of the new framework within a reasonable
	time frame.
	
	<p>Compared to the other emulation modes, there are lots of things left
	to do before the new framework can be considered working:
	There are no lookup tables for fast loads/stores, no fast pc-to-pointer
	lookups, no interrupt/trap/exception handling, no timers,
	no breakpoint support, no general expression parsing, no I/O
	(serial controllers nor graphical output handlers), no disk or
	ethernet support, no MMU/virtual memory translation, and snapshotting
	(for reverse debugging) isn't implemented yet. Still, it is probably
	better to make many smaller releases (0.6.x) than to wait until
	everything is in place.

	<p>There is also a (bogus) <tt>testmips</tt> machine which will be
	implemented using the new framework. To use the old <tt>testmips</tt>
	machine, please use the name <tt>oldtestmips</tt> instead.
</ul>

<p>In addition to the new framework, a couple of other changes are worth
mentioning:

<ul>

  <li>Many unused, rarely used, and bogus emulation modes and features
  	were removed, to reduce the maintenance burden.

  <p>
  <li>Some operating systems listed on the
	  <a href="guestoses.html">guest OS page</a> have had new releases;
	  the documentation has been updated to reflect this.

  <p>
  <li>New source code (but not the legacy part) is
  	<a href="doxygen/html/index.html">documented using Doxygen comments</a>,
  	and there is a unit testing framework in place.

  <p>
  <li>There is now finally an <tt>install</tt> Makefile target, and
  	the <tt>-j</tt> make option can be used to parallelize builds.
  
</ul>


<p><br>Please read the HISTORY file for more details.

<p><br>Files included in this release are:<pre>
    HISTORY                       Detailed revision history / changelog.
    LICENSE                       Copyright message / license.
    README                        Quick start instructions, for the impatient.
    configure, Makefile.skel      sh and make scripts for building GXemul.
    demos/                        Tutorial-like demos of testmachine functionality.
    <a href="index.html">doc/</a>                          Documentation. (*)
    doc/RELEASE.html              This file.
    <a href="TODO.html">doc/TODO</a>                      TODO notes.
    experiments/                  Experimental code. (Usually not needed.)
    man/                          Man page.
    src/                          Source code.
    test/                         Files used for testing.
</pre>

<p>(*) Note: In general, the documentation refers to how things worked
in pre-0.6.0 releases.

<p>To build the emulator, run the <tt>configure</tt> script, and then run 
<tt>make</tt>. This should hopefully work on most Unix-like systems, with few
or no modifications to the source code.

<p>Regarding files in the <tt>src/include/</tt> directory: only some of 
these are written by me, the rest are from other sources
(such as <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a>).

"software") in any advertising materials, I am still very grateful for the 
fact that these people have made their files available for re-use, as Free
