<h1>TODO list for GXemul</h1>
<p>

<a href="./">Back to the index.</a>


<p>Because of severe lack of spare time that can be allocated to the GXemul
project, the first 0.6.x releases will most likely not be very meaningful to
end-users, since almost all old features will be deprecated/legacy features,
and the new features will only work with <tt>testm88k</tt> (which most users
will not care about). Still, it feels like the way to go forward.

<p>(The name "0.5.x" was skipped. This was the C++ version that was supposed
to be a complete rewrite from scratch, with no legacy mode support.
There was not enough spare time.)


<p><pre>

Some things, in no specific order, that I'd like to fix:
(Some items in this list are perhaps already fixed.)

<i>Legend:

[ ] = not started yet, or just planning/thinking about it
[/] = started, either "on paper" or actual implementation
[X] = done  (but usually these entries are removed from the TODO list)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
</i>

  [/]	Improve dyntrans CTRL-C behavior! Abort quicker.
  	[X]  Implement an abort instruction call
  		[X]  sync pc should take this kind of abort into consideration.
	[X]  Rename exceptionInDelaySlot -> exceptionOrAbortInDelaySlot
	[X]  Get rid of abort_in_delay_slot (handled by abort).
	[/]  Unit tests for the above (M88K).
  	[/]  Function call trace -> abort quickly on ctrl-c.
  		[ ]  There is still a crash bug; try interleaving continue +
  			CTRL-C + continue + CTRL-C, with trace enabled!

  [ ]	Refactor/move helper functions into some helper module:
	[ ]  SplitStringIntoVector
	[ ]  parse_number

  [ ]	Plugin framework
  	Note: The term "Plugin" does not mean dynamically loaded. It simply is a
  	generalization of "something" which is the common base for file loaders,
  	framebuffers, statistics viewers, etc.
	[ ] Base class for plugins.
	[ ] Plugin registry.
	[ ] MOVE src/main/fileloaders TO PLUGINS!!! --------------------------
	[ ] On-reset commands should be _PER COMPONENT_ instead of per GXemul
		instance (will likely be good for testm88k-reset, stack pointer etc.)
		[ ] Serialize the on-reset command list (per component) 
	[ ] Plugins may be attached to component paths!
		[ ] Multiple components to one plugin (e.g. keyboard + framebuffer to one plugin)
		[ ] Multiple plugins monitoring the same component.
	[ ] Think about the "load" command. Load vs attach?
	[ ] What should a plugin be able to do?
		[ ] Attach/load
		[ ] On-reset
		[ ] Detach
		[ ] Monitor changes in component(s)' state
		[ ] Periodical updates (e.g. framebuffers)
		[ ] Run in a different thread (pthread multithreading?)
		[ ] Insert stuff into the event queue (e.g. keyboard keypresses
			from a framebuffer/keyboard plugin)
	[ ] The Snapshots (the clones) release the plugin connection; the plugins only
		work on the main tree.
	[ ] Plugins have to be compatible with replaying during reverse execution!
		(Maybe they should be disconnected while re-executing?)
	[ ] Think about how events should contain changes such as breakpoints,
		added/removed plugins, etc.
	[ ] Example plugins:
		[ ] File loaders
		[ ] Disk image mappers
		[ ] Framebuffer displays
			[ ] Think about VGA (charcell AND video framebuffer, being able
				to switch live)
		[ ] Keyboards (host -> emulated)
		[ ] Serial controller -> scrollback buffer -> xterm / other window
			or even connected to stdin/stdout or files or terminals.
		[ ] Audio (emulated -> host)
		[ ] Cache statistics viewer.

	[ ]  CONSISTENT and extensible way of supplying files, disk images,
		raw files, ... to various plugins on the command line,
		e.g.:
			[component:]filename

		where cpu0 would be the default component. This would make it
		look nice when adding disk images, like wd0:netbsd.img

			[component:][plugin([args]):]name

		e.g. loader could be raw(vaddr[,skiplen[,entry]])
		or                   file(raw(vaddr[,skiplen[,entry]]))

		so,	monkey:filename		would load into component monkey
		but	monkey():filename	would load into the default comonent
						using the monkey loader.
		and	a:b(c):filename		would load into component a using
						the b loader, with args c

		"Plugin descriptors"
			optional component
			optional plugin([args])
			optional name

		If all fields are left out, it's an empty descriptor, which is
		ignored. GXemul's command line syntax would then be:
		
			gxemul [options] [.gxemul file] [plugin descriptors...]

		[ ]  The set of loaders to ask could be different depending on
		     which interfaces the component supports. For AddressDataBus,
		     it would be the regular file loaders (ELF, raw, a.out, ...).

		     For block devices (disks, e.g. wd0, sd0), it would be a
		     disk image mapper.

		filename is also optional, and in fact more like a second
		argument. E.g. the sdl() plugin doesn't need a filename.

		The "load" command could be replaced by some kind of "attach"
		command, which would run the same thing as the plugin descriptors
		entered on the command line:
		
		Example output:
			GXemul> attach wd0:netbsd.img
			wd0: Attaching to image(): netbsd.img
			     SCSI disk image, 2400 MB

			GXemul> attach vfb:sdl(apa bepa)
			vfb0: Unable to attaching to sdl(apa bepa)
			Invalid arguments to sdl().

			GXemul> attach vfb:sdl()
			vfb0: Attaching to sdl()

			GXemul> attach test/FileLoader_A.OUT_M88K
			cpu0: Attaching to file(): test/FileLoader_A.OUT_M88K
			      a.out: entry point 0x000012b8
			      text + data = 4096 + 4096 bytes
			      symbols: 1260 bytes at 0x2000
			      strings: 1070 bytes at 0x24ec
			      14 symbols read

		Note that the load command should still be used for loading
		[parts of] emulation setups!

		Think more about this!
		----------------------

			netbsd-GENERIC.gz			(load a basic file into cpu0)
			cpu1:netbsd-GENERIC.gz			(load into a specific cpu)
			wd0:netbsd.img				(disk image file mapper)
			wd0:image(readonly):netbsd.img		(mapper with arguments! non-writable image)
			wd0:image(cow):netbsd.img		(non-writable, but COW to temporary file (TMPDIR))
			cpu0.dcache:cachestatisticsviewer()
			vga0:sdl()				(for displaying graphical controllers, which can
								be interrogated about memory format, resolution etc)
			vga0:sdl(DISPLAY=othermachine:1.0)	(sdl on remote display)
			fb_videoram0:sdl(x=800,y=600,data=rgb24) (for displaying raw memory ranges)
			com0:stdio()		(default stdio)
			com0:xterm()		(new xterm)
			...

		com0:stdio() should not be needed, if it is the default
		choice. com0:null() would disconnect com0 from any output.
		stdio() would then have to be a plugin which handles multi-
		plexing of multiple outputs, and allows one input serial
		console.

  [/]	The testm88k machine.

	[X]  Implement 88100 instruction disassembly.
	[X]  Implement basic 88K instruction execution, enough to run
	     the rectangle drawing demo.
	[ ]  Framebuffer output?
		[ ]  Start thinking about the plugin framework, use sdl
		     for video output!

  [/]	The testmips machine.

	[X]  Implement basic 32-bit MIPS instruction execution, enough to run
	     the rectangle drawing demo.
	[ ]  Implement basic 64-bit MIPS instruction execution, enough to run
	     the 64-bit variant of the rectangle drawing demo.
	[ ]  Implement basic 16-bit MIPS instruction encoding, enough to run
	     the 16-bit-encoded variant of the rectangle drawing demo (on both
	     64-bit and 32-bit emulated CPUs).
	[ ]  All the other devices (interrupts, ethernet, serial, SMP, ...)

  [/]	STEP EXECUTIONS, REVERSE EXECUTION, SNAPSHOTTING, ...

	[/] Continuous execution forward.
		[ ]  "Sloppy" accuracy mode: it could be possible to
		     interleave large chunks even when components "collide"
		     in time. (This will cause reverse execution support to
		     be turned off.)

	[ ] step recalculation:
		[ ] When a component is added to the tree, recalculate its nr of steps!
		[/] "paused" cpu state, in SMP machines during bootup. (Non-executing components.)
		    [ ] When a component changes state from paused = true to false,
		        recalculate its number of steps!
		[ ] Removing components (at least if the Fastest one is removed) should
		    also trigger recalculation.
		[ ] When a component's frequency is changed, recalculate its nr of steps!
		    (This requires variable write handlers, including inheritance!)
		    Frequency changes are tricky, especially when it comes to reverse
		    execution, so think CAREFULLY about this!

	[/] Reverse execution/debugging:
		[ ]  When running in reverse, debug output should be disabled!
			(Also, update calls to plugins (e.g. framebuffers) should
			be disabled, until the target step is reached.)
		[ ]  Regular saving of state, and limiting the number of such
		     saves by logarithmic removal.
		[ ]  Disk image overlays!
			[ ]  Unit tests.
		[ ]  In addition to saving state, all modifications done to the
		     component tree, and e.g. breakpoints, need to be stored
		     together with their time stamp ("step"). And also all
		     "external events", of course.
		     * I.e. if a USB storage device is connected as step 1000, and we're
		       running in reverse to step 800 to check something, and
		       then continue again, the default behaviour should be that
		       at step 1000 the USB device is connected again.
		     * Or if we run 10 steps, change cpu0.pc, and run 10 more steps,
		       then running backwards 10 steps could work, but not more?
		       Think about this!
		[ ]  Simulation across multiple hosts?

	[ ]  Cycle accurate slowdown? E.g. when simulating a 1 MHz microcontroller,
		and a TV display, maybe the host is much faster than what is
		required. The gxemul process could then yield some of its CPU time,
		just about enough to make the process run at real-time speed.
		(With warnings printed whenever real-time is not possible, because
		the host is too slow.) This would be useful for some simulations
		involving real-world Sound producing devices.

  [/]	NEW DYNTRANS IMPLEMENTATION, ...

	[/]  Basic run loop.
		[X]  PC to pointers
			[X]  Dyntrans page allocation
		[/]  Large chunks is safe vs "single stepping" dyntrans...
			[ ] Only "size 2" so far, i.e. delay slots. No support for
			    longer instruction combos have been implemented yet.
		[/]  Unit tests.

	[ ]  Memory writes => invalidate corresponding dyntrans translation pages!
	     (needed for full guest OS emulation, and self-modifying code)

	[ ]  Interrupts should be cycle accurate, and affect the cpu's
	     m_nextIC (and other state, such as processor status registers)
	     _immediately_.

	[/]  Helpers for CPU implementations:
		[X]  dyntrans pages?
		[ ]  pc to dyntrans page lookups? 32-bit and 64-bit
		[ ]  memory to direct host page lookups, TLB-entry based

	[ ]  For instruction combination implementations, the first thing
	     checked is whether instr combos is allowed, if not then call
	     the original function call instead. This makes it possible to
	     run fast, and then "break slowly" before a hazard.

	[ ]  Try variable-length ISAs early on. Maybe amd64? Or AVR32?

	[ ]  Multi-encoding ISAs, such as MIPS (MIPS16), ARM (Thumb).

		Commands used to compile MIPS16 test programs:
		mips64-unknown-elf-gcc-4.3.2 -mips16 -O3 urk.c -c
		mips64-unknown-elf-ld urk.o -o urk -e f -Ttext 0xffffffff80004000

	[ ]  Optional native code generation: Probably don't have time to
		implement this in the near future; everything else also needs
		to be prioritized against this feature, so...

	[ ] Instruction cache emulation
		[ ]  cache component on cpus
		[ ]  For each emulated instruction, call a stub handler with
		     the current pc. It is responsible for updating statistics etc.
		     (Only for cycle accurate emulation, not for sloppy emulation?)
		     (Or should there be a separate setting for cache vs non-cache
		     emulation?)

	[ ] Generic bus load/store access:
		[ ] Pointers to host memory pages, for fast loads and stores:
			[ ]  host_load and host_store (as before)
			[ ]  host_load_user and host_store_user (as before,
			     for those archs that need it, e.g. ARM and M88K?)
		[ ]  Pointers to handler functions, for:
			[ ]  device access
			[ ]  data cache emulation
			[ ]  breakpoints
			[ ]  Investigate: http://vm-kernel.org/blog/2009/07/10/qemu-internal-part-2-softmmu/
			     indicates that QEMU uses similar lookup mechanisms as GXemul, but
			     uses an additional bit in the looked up page address to indicate
			     I/O space. Investigate whether this is faster than having a pure
			     pointer, and a separate lookup when the pointer is NULL!

	[ ] Conditional breakpoints before AND after device accesses!

	[ ] Conditional breakpoints before AND after CPU instruction
	    execution (somewhat different from generic device access).

  [/]	The MVME187 machine.

	[X]  Loading OpenBSD/mvme88k bsd and bsd.rd executables!
	     I.e. implement an a.out file loader.
	[ ]  More initial register contents upon reset: r31 isn't enough for
	     mvme187. See old machine_mvme88k.cc for details.
		[ ]  Soft PROM emulation.
			MAYBE implement PROM emulation as a plugin? Like

				attach cpu0:mvmeprom(187)

			or even just:  attach mvmeprom(187)
			since cpu0 would be the default component.

			The plugin would then be responsible for on-reset
			behavior, AND handling of PROM calls.

			If a software PROM emulation plugin is used for
			emulating different boot loaders, then that can be
			specified as arguments, like:  bootregs=linux or
			bootregs=netbsd  or similar.

     	[ ]  -Q command line flag (backwards compatibility) for
     	     turning off soft PROM emulation?
     	[ ]  Ability to load raw files (e.g. PROM).
	[ ]  Serial controller component.
	[ ]  Plugin (?) for serial output (i.e. a terminal window), or
	     posibility to connect to stdin/stdout. Should be enough to
	     show boot messages.
	[ ]  Separate 88200 CMMUs? So that the two are really two
	     separate devices.
	[ ]  Implement 88K virtual to physical memory translation.
	[/]  Implement 88100 instruction execution (completely).
	[ ]  Implement 88110 instruction disassembly (e.g. "graphics" instructions)
	[ ]  Implement 88110 instruction execution.
	[ ]  Disk bootblock boot.
	[ ]  Reimplement everything from the old mvme187 implementation.
	[ ]  Ethernet :)
	[ ]  Dyntrans "user memory" implementation for M88K!
	[ ]  xmem emulation (set transaction registers)
	[ ]  Instruction trace by using bits of ??IP control regs.
	[ ]  Breakpoints: How to indicate user space vs supervisor? (Also the
	    "dump" instruction and other things need this support.)
	[ ]  Instruction disassembly, and implementation:
		o)  See http://www.panggih.staff.ugm.ac.id/download/GCC/info/gcc.i5
		    for some strange cases of when "div" can fail (?)
		o)  Floating point stuff:
			+) Refactor all the fsub, fadd, fmul etc. They
			   are currently quite horribly redundant.
			+) Exceptions for overflow etc!

  [ ]	Address formats?
  	"xxxx:yyyy", "xxxx:yyyyyyyy", "zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz" for amd64, plus i/o ports
  	"uxxxxxxxx" vs "sxxxxxxxx" for M88K
	most likely others for "bank select" embedded archs/microcontrollers.

  [ ]	amd64/x86 emulation:
  	a) Non-dyntrans emulation mode, as a "proof" that CPUs can be implemented
	   using slow interpretation, and do not need to be complex dyntrans 
	   implementations. (PC emulation isn't exactly GXemul's niche, anyway,
	   so it is ok that it is extremely slow. There are other emulators
	   and virtualizers for users who need a fast x86/amd64 experience.)
	b) interesting because of mode switches (16-bit, 32-bit, and long 64-bit)
	c) interseting because of odd address format (non-RISC style)
	d) interesting because there are lots of guest OSes and other software
	   to test with
	e) how about making the name "pc" in CPUComponent overridable? on amd64,
	   it is either ip, eip, or rip, depending on mode.
	f) override bus reads/writes, because amd64 transparently allows
	   unaligned loads/stores.

  [ ]	Memory/bus reads in "no exception" mode (for disasm and memory dumping,
  	and other things).

  [/]	Symbol registry.
  	[X]  Add ELF symbols (see end of FileLoader_ELF.cc).
  	[X]  Load a.out symbols.
  	[ ]  Cloning a CPUComponent should also clone its symbol registry!
  	     Think about serializing symbols...

  [ ]   Make sure that BOTH old and new configuration files work!

  [ ]	Niceness fixes:
  	[/]  make refcount_ptr&lt;T&gt; support const T as well, so that e.g. code in
  	     Component::LookupPath can be made to work without a const_cast!
  	[ ]  avoid exceptions (better to return failure some other way)

  [ ]	Call m_gxemul->GetRootComponent()->FlushCachedState(); when a component
  	is e.g. moved or copied?  Example: cpu0 in machine0 is moved to machine1,
  	and then cpu.dump is executed. It should then use the mainbus of machine1,
  	not machine0!  (Maybe not necessary for interactive use; FlushCachedState
  	is called by consoleui before very command... hm.)

  [ ]	Cache short path names if evaluation/generation of them becomes too heavy.

  [/]	Mainbus component:
	[ ]  Maybe this should simply be a "Bus" base class? That way,
	     it could be reused by PCI Busses, VME busses, and others. HOWEVER,
	     the concept of address range and overlap may differ between
	     bus types, or maybe not even exist in some busses.
	[ ]  AddressDataBus should be extended to allow for direct
	     page mapping.
	[ ]  Unit tests for the above!

  [ ]	Interrupt subsystem
   	[ ]  Components exposing an InterruptPin interface? Think about this...

  [ ]	Timers
	[ ]  Host speed approaching timers:  a device that wishes
	     to cause interrupts 100 times per emulated second
	     will interrupt (approximately) 100 times per host
	     second. This is most useful for running full guest
	     operating systems at full speed, "virtual machine"
	     mode.
	[ ]  Exact emulation:  a device wishing to cause 100
	     interrupts per emulated second may take much more
	     or much less than one host second to execute.
	     ("Cycle accurate" mode.)

   [/]  State/model:
        [X]  Variable write handlers.
             [ ] root.step to move to a certain execution step!
             	 [X] Change backward-step to set root.step = root.step - 1.
             	 [ ] Only allow decreasing root.step if snapshots are enabled.
             	 [ ] Allow increasing root.step always: it means to continue until
             	     the number of steps have been executed (a kind of specia breakpoint!)
             	 [X] Do not allow writes to *.step for non-root components!
             	 [X] Do not check writes to *.step during deserialization!
	     [X] cpu.model = "R4000"   <==  assigning to the "model" variable should:
	  	[X]  handle writes specifically
	  	[X]  lookup if R4000 is a valid model for the cpu architecture
	  	[ ]  Better error reporting when supplying model using e.g.
	  	     the command line   -e "testmips(cpu=R1000)"  should show
	  	     the same error message as when running cpu.model="R1000".
	[ ]  MIPS ABI selection now works (cpu.abi="o32" vs n32 and n64). However,
	     only the NEW names are registered as state variable names! How should
	     this be handled? Custom "aliasing" variables?
	[ ]  Custom ToString variants? Useful for bit fields, control
	     registers, etc. "Verbose tostring"?
	[ ]  Loaded files should be part of state/model! But not part
	     of the component tree. I.e. state = components +
	     other configuration!
	[ ]  Disk images: reverse execution should reverse disk contents,
	     i.e. overlays must be used if reverse execution support is
	     enabled.

  [ ]	Serialize symbols

  [ ]	Serialize breakpoints

  [ ]	File loaders:
   	[ ]  automagic .gz (and .bz2) file extraction into /tmp or $TMP or such.
	[ ]  symbol handling, line number info, data types?
	[ ]  argument handling! (arg count, at least)
	[ ]  all the others (macho, ecoff, srec, ...)

  [ ]  Disk images.
	[ ]  r vs R modifier: read only disk images causes writes to
	     fail, while R could create an implicit empty overlay
	     in the tmp directory, so that writes within a session
	     will succeed. At reboot/reset they'd be lost.

  [ ]	Breakpoints

	Breakpoint = some form of expression, which will be evaluated
	after (or before?) running each cycle. (*)
	
	(*) Implementation-wise, it may be optimized away, but the semantics
	should be this.

	NOTE: It will not be possible to break INSIDE a component's step,
	but only before or after all components within that step have
	executed. I.e.:
	o) when single-stepping, the breakpoint may simply set a flag during
	   execution, and when all components within that step have executed,
	   the resulting triggered breakpoints may be displayed.
	o) when running continuously, the breakpoint may still not break immediately
	   (?) because components may be mixed within the last step? TODO: Think
	   about this.

	TODO: Any state variable change in any component? How about RAM/custom
	changes? How about register _READS_ or custom reads.

	All Load/stores to virtual addresses?

	[ ]  For all breakpoints, it should be possible to break
	     both _before_ and _after_ a change has occurred!

	[ ]  For all breakpoints/watchpoints, a Count should be kept, and the
	     emulation should only break once the Count has reached a limit.
	     (Usually 1, but should be possible to set to any positive value.)

	[ ]  Worst case: Checked on device cycle execution, if necessary.

	[ ]  Per memory-mapped/addressable device
	     Checked on load/store device access.

	[ ]  Per instruction (for CPU components)
	     It may be easiest to simply turn off native code
	     generation, except for stuff like "check if pc = xyz"-
	     style breakpoints. Those can be embedded.

   [/]  Function call trace etc.
   	[ ]  string lookup for args
   	[ ]  symbol lookup for args
   	[ ]  Document in doc/components/component_cpu.html how to use
   	     tracing, what the showFunction* state variables do, etc.
   	[ ]  trace command (taking an argument: nr of calls, default is 1?)
   		which is the same as setting a breakpoint for cpuX.nrOfFunctionCalls = Z
   		where Z is one more than before than it was before running the command.
   		And each function call increases that variable.
   		trace then temporarily turns on showFunctionTraceCall and
   		runs until the breakpoint hits (or CTRL-C), and then removes
   		the breakpoint automatically (even if CTRL-C was hit), and
   		restores showFunctionTraceCall.
	     Variants:	trace on	turns on tracing for all CPUs (but doesn't
	     				run anything)
	     		trace off	turns off tracing for all CPUs
	     		trace [n]	runs with trace enabled for n function calls,
	     				n = 10 by default?
	     showFunctionCallReturn should be false by default.
	[ ]  -t command line option, for backward compatibility?

   [ ]  Stack dump (of the emulated machine)
   	[ ]  A method on CPU components?

   [ ]	Components (general):
	[ ]  "help" about components could show a file:/// link to
	     the installed documentation about that component or
	     machine! (If it exists.) Fallback: refer to the machine or
	     component on gxemul.sourceforge.net (but warn about
	     versions).
	[ ]  Limit where components can be added. Like "drop targets"?
		E.g. a machine can be added at the root, but a machine can not
		be added on a pcibus. Similarly, a pcibus can not be added
		at the root. It has to be in a machine of some kind.
		Think about this. Perhaps as simple as a "if parent class is
		not blah blah then disallow adding".
			A machine can be added into a dummy component.
			A dummy component can be added into a dummy component.
			A pcibus can be added into a mainbus (in a machine.)
			etc.
		bool IsItOkToAddItToThisProposedParentComponent(propsedParent) const;

  [ ]	ConsoleUI and/or CommandInterpreter: Make use of COLUMNS environment variable
	when printing e.g. tab completion tables.

  [ ]	Command interpreter:

	[/]  State variable assignments:
		[ ]  Expression evaluator, +-*/, string concatenation, type
		     correctness (e.g. bool vs int), hex vs decimal,
		     prefixes like M, K etc.  (4M = 4*1048576 ...)
			(StateVariable::EvaluateExpression)
		[ ]  Execution of _expressions_, not just variables. e.g.:
			cpu.pc		prints the pc value
			cpu.pc+4	should print the _expression_ pc+4
			cpu.pc=expr	assignment

	[ ]  Minimal paths ala machine0.cpu0 would be cool if they worked.
	     I.e. if there's machine0.mainbus0.cpu0 and machine1.mainbus0.cpu0,
	     but no mainbus1, then machineX.cpu0 would be shorter, and still
	     uniquely identify the cpu.

	[ ]  Help on methods and method arguments? E.g. cpu.unassemble [addr]

	[ ]  Right now, entering a command such as "c" says "unknown command".
	     It should say "ambigous command"!

	[/]  Tab completion for everything:

		[ ]  tab completion should use the Shortest Path, not the
		     full path. E.g.:  cpu + TAB should expand to cpu0 only
		     in a default testmips machine, NOT root.machine0.mainbus0.cpu0!
		     This will most likely require a change in unit tests etc.

		[ ]  syntax based completion? e.g.:
			help [cmd]   tab completes the first argument as a
				     command
			add component-name		-- component name
			load [filename [component-path]]  -- filename etc.

		     This will require a uniform way of describing arguments,
		     and whether or not they should be optional. The tab
		     completer must then parse the command line, including
		     figuring out which arguments were optional, etc.

		     Also, when such syntax is taken into account, the
		     CommandInterpreter can check syntax _before_ running
		     Command::Execute. That means that individual Commands
		     do not have to do manual checking on entry that the
		     number of arguments is correct etc.

			[ ]  filename
			[ ]  command name
			[ ]  component path
			[ ]  optional vs mandatory args...?
			[ ]  scan all commands' args at startup, and have an
				assert() in place, so that unknown arg types
				are caught during development!

	[ ]  Command aliases? e.g.
		d = cpu0.dump
		c = continue
		s = step
		u = cpu.unassemble
	     But maybe the cpu in question may be changed with a "focus" command?
	     Otherwise it would only work with 1 cpu.

	[ ]	recursive component.var
			Dumps a tree of the "var" variable _FROM_ the component,
			i.e. including all children. E.g.
			recursive mainbus0.memoryMappedAddr
			would dump
				mainbus0
				|-- ram0  memoryMappedAddr = 0
				|-- rom0  memoryMappedAddr = 0x1fc00000
				\-- com0  memoryMappedAddr = 0x190003f8
			or something.

	[ ]	recursive component.var = value
			would set the "var" variable in the component including
			all sub components. Not all components may have the
			variable, so debug output should indicate which variables
			were set and which were not set.

   [/]	RAM component:
	[ ]  Make the save/load of state more efficient. Right now, it's a hex dump! Yuck.
	[ ]  methods for searching for values (strings, words, etc?)
	[ ]  methods for bulk fill/copy [from other address/data busses?]

   [ ]  Cache components.

	[ ]  Implement the addressable data bus interface, but if data is contained
	     in the cache (a small memory area), do not call the main memory.
	     Rather straight-forward idea, but will take time to implement
	     all common variants: associativity, statistics gathering (i.e.
	     "who [i.e. which PC] evicted who [which other PC] from the cache"), ...

		[ ]  Caches should be added _onto_ a cpu. The cpu first looks
		     for a cache as an address data bus, THEN for a parent. Hm.
		[ ]  The cache must then go downwards TWO steps (../..) to get
		     past the owning cpu, when trying to reach the mainbus/ram.

	[ ]  Unit tests.

   [ ]	Floating point helper.

	Make this more complete/accurate than the old one, i.e. support
	inf/nan, exceptions, signaling stuff, denormalized/normalized?

	[ ]  non-IEEE modes (i.e. x86/vax/...)?
	[ ]  Unit tests

   [ ]	Userland emulation

   	[ ]  Begin with e.g. FreeBSD/amd64, or FreeBSD/alpha, NetBSD/something,
   	     or Linux/something.
	[ ]  Try to prefix "/emul/mips/" or similar to all filenames,
	     and only if that fails, try the given filename.
             Read this setting from an environment variable, and only
             if there is none, fall back to hardcoded string.
	[ ]  File descriptor (0,1,2) assumptions? Think about this.
	[ ]  Dynamic linking! (libs from /emul/xxxx etc)
	[ ]  Initial register/stack contents (environment, command line args).
	[ ]  Return value (from main).
	[ ]  mmap emulation layer
	[ ]  errno emulation layer
	[ ]  ioctl emulation layer for all devices :-[
	[ ]  struct conversions for many syscalls



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: MOST of the stuff below are from pre-0.6.0, so the comments may be
      a bit out of date, or more likely, only correspond to the LEGACY parts
      of the code.
      
      The long-term goal is to rewrite everything using the new framework,
      and therefore the comments below will either be incorporated in the
      rewrite, or they are not applicable any longer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



MIPS:
	o)  Nicer MIPS status bits in register dumps.
	o)  Floating point exception correctness.
	o)  Fix this? Triggered by NetBSD/sgimips? Hm:
		to_be_translated(): TODO: unimplemented instruction:
		000000000065102c: 00200800 (d)  rot_00  at,zr,0
	o)  Some more work on opcodes.
		x) MIPS64 revision 2.
			o)  Find out which actual CPUs implement the rev2 ISA!
			o)  DINS, DINSM, DINSU etc
			o)  DROTR32 and similar MIPS64 rev 2 instructions,
			    which have a rotation bit which differs from
			    previous ISAs.
		x) _MAYBE_ TX79 and R5900 actually differ in their
		   opcodes? Check this carefully!
	o)  Dyntrans: Count register updates are probably not 100% correct yet.
	o)  (Re)implement 128-bit loads/stores for R5900.
	o)  Coprocessor 1x (i.e. 3) should cause cp1 exceptions, not 3?
		(See http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2007-05/msg00005.html)
	o)  R4000 and others:
		x)  watchhi/watchlo exceptions, and other exception
		    handling details
	o)  MIPS 5K* have 42 physical address bits, not 40/44?
	o)  R10000 and others:  (R12000, R14000 ?)
		x)  The code before the line
			/*  reg[COP0_PAGEMASK] = cpu->cd.mips.coproc[0]->tlbs[0].mask & PAGEMASK_MASK;  */
		    in cpu_mips.c is not correct for R10000 according to
		    Lemote's Godson patches for GXemul. TODO: Go through all
		    register definitions according to http://techpubs.sgi.com/library/tpl/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi/hdwr/bks/SGI_Developer/books/R10K_UM/sgi_html/t5.Ver.2.0.book_263.html#HEADING334
		    and make sure everything works with R10000.
		    Then test with OpenBSD/sgi?
		x)  Entry LO mask (as above).
		x)  memory space, exceptions, ...
		x)  use cop0 framemask for tlb lookups
		    (http://techpubs.sgi.com/library/tpl/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi/hdwr/bks/SGI_Developer/books/R10K_UM/sgi_html/t5.Ver.2.0.book_284.html)
	o)  Playstation 2 with NetBSD? Perhaps USB keyboard is a big step
	    on the way to running the whole OS. (?)

SuperH:
	x)  Auto-generation of loads/stores! This should get rid of at least
	    the endianness check in each load/store.
	x)  Experiment with whether or not correct ITLB emulation is
	    actually needed. (20070522: I'm turning it off today.)
	x)  SH4 interrupt controller:
		x)  MASKING should be possible!
	x)  SH4 UBC (0xff200000)
	x)  SH4 DMA (0xffa00000): non-dreamcast-PVR modes
	x)  Store queues can copy 32 bytes at a time, there's no need to
	    copy individual 32-bit words. (Performance improvement.)
	    (Except that e.g. the Dreamcast TA currently receives using
	    32-bit words... hm)
	x)  SH4 BSC (Bus State Controller)
	x)  Instruction tracing should include symbols for branch targets,
	    and so on, to make the output more human readable.
	x)  SH3-specific devices: Pretty much everything!
	x)  NetBSD/evbsh3, hpcsh! Linux?
	x)  Floating point speed!
	x)  Floating point exception correctness.
		E.g. fipr and the other "geometric" instructions should
		throw an exception if the "precision" bit is wrong
		(since the geometric instructions loose precision).
		See the manual about this!
	x)  Exceptions for unaligned load/stores. OpenBSD/landisk uses
	    this mechanism for its reboot code (machine_reset).

Dreamcast:
	x)  Try to make the ROM from my real Dreamcast boot.
	x)  PVR:  Lots of stuff. See dev_pvr.c.
		x)  DMA to non-0x10000000
		x)  Textures...
		x)  Make it fast! if possible
	x)  G2 DMA
	x)  SPU: Sound emulation (ARM cpu).
	x)  LAN adapter (dev_mb8696x.c).  NetBSD root-on-nfs.
	x)  Better GDROM support
	x)  Modem
	x)  PCI bridge/bus?
	x)  Maple bus:
		x)  Correct controller input
		x)  Mouse input
	x)  Software emulation of BIOS calls:
		x)  GD-ROM emulation: Use the GDROM device.
		x)  Use the VGA font as a fake ROM font. (Better than
		    nothing.)
	x)  Make as many as possible of the KOS examples run!
	x)  More homebrew demos/games.
	x)  VME processor emulation? "(Sanyo LC8670 "Potato")" according to
	    Wikipedia, LC86K87 according to Comstedt's page. See
	    http://www.maushammer.com/vmu.html for a good description of
	    the differences between LC86104C and the one used in the VME.

POWER/PowerPC:
	x)  Fix DECR timer speed, so it matches the host.
	x)  NetBSD/prep 3.x triggers a possible bug in the emulator:
	    <wdc_exec_command(0xd005e514,0xd60cdd30,0,8,..)>
	      <ata_get_xfer(0,0xd60cdd30,0,8,..)>
	        <0x26c550(&ata_xfer_pool,2,0,8,..)>
	        <0x35c71c(0x3f27000,0,52,8,..)>
	      <ata_exec_xfer(0xd005e4c8,0x3f27000,0,13,..)>
	        <atastart(0xd005e4c8,0x3f27000,0,13,..)>
	          <__wdccommand_start(0xd005e4c8,0x3f27000,0,13,..)>
	            <bsw1(&prep_isa_io_space_tag,0x800001f6,0,176,..)>
		[ wdc: write to SDH: 0xb0 (sectorsize 2, lba=1, drive 1, head 0) ]
	            <wdcwait(0xd005e4c8,72,64,0xbb8,..)>
	              <0x198120(0xd005e4c8,72,64,0xbb8,..)>
	                <bsr1(&prep_isa_io_space_tag,0,0,0xbb8,..)>
	                <delay(100,0,0,0xbb8,..)>
	    Note: <bsr1(&prep_isa_io_space_tag,0,0,0xbb8,..)>
	x)  PPC optimizations; instr combs
	x)  64-bit stuff: either Linux on G5, or perhaps some hobbyist
		version of AIX? (if there exists such a thing)
	x)  macppc: adb controller; keyboard (for framebuffer mode)
	x)  make OpenBSD/macppc work (PCI controller stuff)
	x)  Floating point exception correctness.
	x)  Alignment exceptions.

PReP:
	x)  Clock time! ("Bad battery blah blah")

Algor:
	o)  Other models than the P5064?
	o)  PCI interrupts... needed for stuff like the tlp NIC?

Malta:
	o)  The Linux/Malta kernel at people.debian.org/~ths/qemu/malta/
	    almost works:
		./gxemul -x -o 'rd_start=0x80800000 rd_size=10000000 init=/bin/sh' -C 4KEc
		  -e malta 0x80800000:people.debian.org/~ths/qemu/malta/initrd.gz 
		  people.debian.org/~ths/qemu/malta/vmlinux
	    (Remove "init=/bin/sh" to boot into the Debian installer.)
	    There are at least two things that need to be fixed:
		1. PCI IDE; make Linux oops.
		2. Implement the NIC.

SGI O2:
	Play around with the SGI O2 PROM image again, from the real O2.

	0.3.7: Ok, starts up with graphics (_IF_ the cache detection is skipped)

	20051112: Ok with graphics
	20051127: Ok
	20051201: Ok			-- Somewhere between 20051201 and 20051203
	20051203: Not work.		   I apparently lost the graphical boot
	20051211: Does NOT work.

	0.3.8: Boots but switches to serial console ("could not open console") (also with
	       cache detection skipped manually)
	0.4.0: The cache detection breakpoint is not triggered :(

HPCmips:
	x)  Mouse/pad support! :)
	x)  A NIC? (As a PCMCIA device?)

ARM:
	o)  See netwinder_reset() in NetBSD; the current "an internal error
	    occured" message after reboot/halt is too ugly.
	o)  Generic ARM "wait"-like instruction?
	o)  try to get netbsd/evbarm 3.x or 4.x running (iq80321)
	o)  netbsd/iyonix? the i80321 device currently tells netbsd that
	    RAM starts at 0xa0000000, but that is perhaps not correct for the
	    iyonix.
	o)  make the xscale counter registers (ccnt) work
	o)  make the ata controller usable for FreeBSD!
	o)  Debian/cats crashes because of unimplemented coproc stuff.
	    fix this?

Test machines:
	o)  dev_fb 2D acceleration functions, to make dev_fb useful for
	    simple graphical OSes:
		x) block fill and copy
		x) draw characters (from the built-in font)?
	o)  dev_fb input device? mouse pointer coordinates and buttons
		(allow changes in these to cause interrupts as well?)
	o)  Redefine the halt() function so that it stops "sometimes
	    soon", i.e. usage in demo code should be:
		for (;;) {
			halt();
		}
	o)  More demos/examples.

Dyntrans:
	x)  For 32-bit emulation modes, that have emulated TLBs: tlbindex
	    arrays of mapped pages? Things to think about:
		x)  Only 32-bit mode! (64-bit => too much code)
		x)  One array for global pages, and one array _PER ASID_,
		    for those archs that support that. On M88K, there should
		    be one array for userspace, and one for supervisor, etc.
		x)  Larger-than-4K-pages must fill several bits in the array.
		x)  No TLB search will be necessary.
		x)  Total host space used, for 4 KB pages: 1 MB per table,
		    i.e. 65 MB for 32-bit MIPS, 2 MB for M88K, if one byte
		    is used as the tlb index.
		x)  (The index is actually +1, so that 0 means no hit.)
	x)  "Merge" the cur_physpage and cur_ic_page variables/pointers to
	    one? I.e. change cur_ic_page to cur_physpage.ic_page or something.
	x)  Instruction combination collisions? How to avoid easily...
	x)  superh -- no hostpage for e.g. 0x8c000000. devices as ram!
	x)  Think about how to do both SHmedia and SHcompact in a reasonable
	    way! (Or AMD64 long/protected/real, for that matter.)
	x)  68K emulation; think about how to do variable instruction
	    lengths across page boundaries.
	x)  Dyntrans with valgrind-inspired memory checker. (In memory_rw,
	    it would be reasonably simple to add; in each individual fast
	    load/store routine = a lot more work, and it would become
	    kludgy very fast.)
		o)  Mark every address with bits which tell whether or not the address
		    has been written to.
		o)  What should happen when programs are loaded?  Text/data, bss (zero
		    filled). But stack space and heap is uninitialized.
		o)  Uninitialized local variables:
			A load from a place on the stack which has not previously
			been stored to => warning. Increasing the stack pointer using
			any available means should reset the memory to uninitialized.
		o)  If calls to malloc() and free() can be intercepted:
			o)  Access to a memory area after free() => warning.
			o)  Memory returned by malloc() is marked as not-initialized.
			o)  Non-passive, but good to have: Change the argument
			    given to malloc, to return a slightly larger memory
			    area, i.e.  margin_before + size + margin_after,
			    and return the pointer  + margin_before.
			    Any access to the margin_before or _after space results
			    in warnings. (free() must be modified to free the
			    actually allocated address.)
	x)  Dyntrans with SMP... lots of work to be done here.
	x)  Dyntrans with cache emulation... lots of work here as well.
	x)  Remove the concept of base RAM completely; it would be more
	    generic to allow RAM devices to be used "anywhere".
	o)  dev_mp doesn't work well with dyntrans yet
	o)  In general, IPIs, CAS, LL/SC etc must be made to work with dyntrans
	x)  Redesign/rethink the delay slot mechanism used for e.g. MIPS,
		so that it caches a translation (that is, an instruction
		word and the instr_call it was translated to the last
		time), so that it doesn't need to do slow
		to_be_translated for each end of page?
	x)  Program Counter statistics:
		Per machine? What about SMP? All data to the same file?
		A debugger command should be possible to use to enable/
		disable statistics gathering.
		Configuration file option!
	x)  Breakpoints:
		o) Physical vs virtual addresses!
		o) 32-bit vs 64-bit sign extension for MIPS, and others?
	x)  INVALIDATION should cause translations in _all_ cpus to be
	    invalidated, e.g. on a write to a write-protected page
	    (containing code)
	x)  16-bit encodings? (MIPS16, ARM Thumb, etc)
	x)  Lots of other stuff: see src/cpus/README_DYNTRANS
	x)  Native code generation backends... think carefully about this.

Better CD Image file support:
	x)  Support CD formats that contain more than 1 track, e.g.
	    CDI files (?). These can then contain a mixture of e.g. sound
	    and data tracks, and booting from an ISO filesystem path
	    would boot from [by default] the first data track.
	    (This would make sense for e.g. Dreamcast CD images, or
	    possibly other live-CD formats.)

Networking:
[Obsoleted; the new framework will need a much better net implementation. This
section is kept here, so that the same mistakes may be avoided in the rewrite.]
	x)  Redesign of the networking subsystem, at least the NAT translation
		part. The current way of allowing raw ethernet frames to be
		transfered to/from the emulator via UDP should probably be
		extended to allow the frames to be transmitted other ways as
		well.
	x)  Also adding support for connecting ttys (either to xterms, or to
		pipes/sockets etc, or even to PPP->NAT or SLIP->NAT :-).
	x)  Documentation updates (!) are very important, making it easier to
		use the (already existing) network emulation features.
	x)  Fix performance problems caused by only allowing a
	    single TCP packet to be unacked.
	x)  Don't hardcode offsets into packets!
	x)  Test with lower than 100 max tcp/udp connections,
	    to make sure that reuse works!
	x)  Make OpenBSD work better as a guest OS!
	x)  DHCP? Debian doesn't actually send DHCP packets, even
		though it claims to? So it is hard to test.
	x)  Multiple networks per emulation, and let different
	    NICs in machines connect to different networks.
	x)  Support VDE (vde.sf.net)? Easiest/cleanest (before a
	    redesign of the network framework has been done) is
	    probably to connect it using the current (udp) solution.
	x)  Allow SLIP connections, possibly PPP, in addition to
	    ethernet?

Documentation:
	x)  Update the documentation regarding the testmachine interrupts.
	x)  Note about sandboxing/security:
		Not all emulated instructions fail in the way they would
		do on real hardware (e.g. a userspace program writing to
		a system register might work in GXemul, but it would
		fail on real hardware).  Sandbox = contain from the
		host OS. But the emulated programs will run "less
		securely".
	x)  Rewrite the section about experimental devices, after the
	    framebuffer acceleration has been implemented, and demos
	    written. (Symbolic names instead of numbers; example
	    use cases, etc. Mention demo files that use the various
	    features?)
	x)  "a very simple linear framebuffer device (for graphics output)"
	    under "which machines does gxemul emulate" ==> better
	    description?

The Device subsystem:
	x)  allow devices to be moved and/or changed in size (down to a
	    minimum size, etc, or up to a max size); if there is a collision,
	    return false. It is up to the caller to handle this situation!
	x)  NOTE: Translations must be invalidated, both for
	    registering new devices, and for moving existing ones.
	    cpu->invalidate translation caches, for all CPUs that
	    are connected to a specific memory.

PCI:
[Obsoleted; the new framework will need a much better bus implementation. This
section is kept here, so that the same mistakes may be avoided in the rewrite.]
	x)  Pretty much everything related to runtime configuration, device
	    slots, interrupts, etc must be redesigned/cleaned up. The current
	    code is very hardcoded and ugly.
	o)  Allow cards to be added/removed during runtime more easily.
	o)  Allow cards to be enabled/disabled (i/o ports, etc, like
	    NetBSD needs for disk controller detection).
	o)  Allow devices to be moved in memory during runtime.
	o)  Interrupts per PCI slot, etc. (A-D).
	o)  PCI interrupt controller logic... very hard to get right,
	    because these differ a lot from one machine to the next.
	x)  last write was ffffffff ==> fix this, it should be used
	    together with a mask to get the correct bits. also, not ALL
	    bits are size bits! (lowest 4 vs lowest 2?)
	x)  add support for address fixups
	x)  generalize the interrupt routing stuff (lines etc)

Clocks and timers:
	x)  Fix the PowerPC DECR interrupt speed! (MacPPC and PReP speed, etc.)
	x)  DON'T HARDCODE 100 HZ IN cpu_mips_coproc.c!
	x)  NetWinder timeofday is incorrect! Huh? grep -R for ta_rtc_read in
	    NetBSD sources; it doesn't seem to be initialized _AT ALL_?!
	x)  Cobalt TOD is incorrect!
	x)  Go through all other machines, one by one, and fix them.

ASC SCSI controller:
	x)  NetBSD/arc 2.0 uses the ASC controller in a way which GXemul
	    cannot yet handle. (NetBSD 1.6.2 works ok.) (Possibly a problem
	    in NetBSD itself, http://mail-index.netbsd.org/source-changes/
	    2005/11/06/0024.html suggests that.)
	    NetBSD 4.x seems to work? :)

File/disk/symbol handling:
	o)  Make sure that disks can be added/removed during runtime!
	    (Perhaps this needs a reasonably large re-write.)
	o)  Remove some of the complexity in file format guessing, for
		Ultrix kernels that are actually disk images?
	o)  Remove temporary files (/tmp/gxemul.blahblah) if loading fails
	    for some reason (unrecognized file, etc).
	o)  Better handling of tape files	
	o)  Read function argument count and types from binaries? (ELF?)
	o)  Better demangling of C++ names. Note: GNU's C++ differs from e.g.
	    Microsoft's C++, so multiple schemes must be possible. See
	    URL at top of src/symbol_demangle.c for more info.

Better framebuffer and X-windows functionality:
[Obsoleted; the new framework will most likely use SDL. This section
is kept here, so that the same mistakes may be avoided in the rewrite.]
	o)  Do a complete rewrite of the framebuffer/console stuff, so that:
		1)  It does not rely on X11 specifically.
		2)  It is possible to interact with emulated framebuffers
		    and consoles "remotely", e.g. via a web page which
		    controls multiple virtualized machines.
		3)  It is possible to run on (hypothetical) non-X11
		    graphics systems.
	o)  Generalize the update_x1y1x2y2 stuff to an extend-region()
	    function...
	o)  -Yx sometimes causes crashes.
	o)  Simple device access to framebuffer_blockcopyfill() etc,
	    and text output (using the built-in fonts), for dev_fb.
	o)  CLEAN UP the ugly event code
	o)  Mouse clicks can be "missed" in the current system; this is
	    not good. They should be put on a stack of some kind.
	o)  More 2D and 3D framebuffer acceleration.
	o)  Non-resizable windows?  Or choose scaledown depending
		on size (and center the image, with a black border).
	o)  Different scaledown on different windows?
	o)  Non-integral scale-up? (E.g. 640x480 -> 1024x768)
	o)  Switch scaledown during runtime? (Ala CTRL-ALT-plus/minus)
	o)  Bug reported by Elijah Rutschman on MacOS with weird
	    keys (F5 = cursor down?).
	o)  Keyboard and mouse events:
		x)  Do this for more machines than just DECstation
		x)  more X11 cursor keycodes
		x)  Keys like CTRL, ALT, SHIFT do not get through
		    by themselves (these are necessary for example
		    to change the font of an xterm in X in the
		    emulator)
	o)  Generalize the framebuffer stuff by moving _ALL_ X11
		specific code to a separate module.

Release checklist:
	Build on as many platforms as possible.
	Install as many as possible of the Guest OSes in the documentation;
		the documentation may need to be updated if there are
		regressions. (This can take a whole day.)
	Update the README file.
	Update the RELEASE NOTES.
	TODO updates (i.e. set goals for the _next_ release, if possible).
	HISTORY (mention the release).
	SVN branch/tag.
	Send SVN dump to Sourceforge.
	Tarball creation (make_release.sh)
	Home page update: version numbers, architectures?
	Home page News page update: new Release.
	sync homepage to sourceforge
	#GXemul on FreeNode (IRC): version number in topic
	Sourceforge File Release (upload the tarball).
	gxemul-users mail
	Freshmeat
	Wikipedia page (version number and date, possibly architectures update,
		or description update).
	Send mail to package maintainers (if they are not subscribed
		to the mailing list(s))
	If new arch:
		Linux-MIPS wiki page
		Ohloh description page
		gavare.se main page
