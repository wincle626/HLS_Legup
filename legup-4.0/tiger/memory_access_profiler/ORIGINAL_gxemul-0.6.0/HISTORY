Changelog for GXemul:
---------------------

20030829	Skeleton. ELF stuff. Some instructions.
20030830	Simple test programs using +-*/^|&%, function calls,
		loops, and stuff like that work.
20030903	Adding more instructions, fixing some bugs.
20030907	Making adding of memory mapped devices easier, although
		the framework isn't built for speed.
		Adding a -q switch to turn of debug output.
20030911	Trying to fix some bugs. Minor changes. Some COP0
		registers are now meaningful.
20030919	Making APs (non-bootstrap cpus) available via a simple
		'mp' device. Implementing ll/lld and sc/scd (for atomic
		memory updates, needed by MP operating systems).
20030923	Minor updates: more instructions (divu, mulu, lwu,
		perhaps some more), and opcode usage statistics.
20030924	If the next instruction is nullified (for 'branch
		likely' type of instructions), counters for delays etc
		are now decreased as they should.
		Adding some comments.
		Adding instructions: movz, movn.
		Adding a simple mandelbrot test to mipstest.c.
20030925	Adding instructions: bltzl, bgezl, lh, lhu, sh, mfc*,
		mtc*.
		Adding a dummy instructions: sync, cache.
		Adding minimal DECstation PROM functionality: printf()
		and getsysid() callback functions.
		Beginning work on address translation.
20030927	Adding some more cop0 functionality (tlb stuff).
		Adding mc146818 real-time clock. (Skeleton stuff.)
20030928	Adding a dc7085 serial console device (dummy, but enough
		to output chars to the screen). NetBSD uses this for
		the MIPSMATE 5100.
20030929	Working on the TLB stuff.
		Adding instructions: srlv, tlbwr, tlbr, tlbp, eret.
20030930	Trying to find a bug which causes NetBSD to bug out, but
		it is really hard.
		Adding some a.out support (for loading an old
		OpenBSD 2.8/pmax kernel image).
		Adding instructions: lwc*, ldc*, swc1 and swc3.
		Beginning to add special code to handle the differences
		between R4000 (the default emulation) and R2000/R3000.
20031001	Symbol listings produced by 'nm -S' can be used to
		show symbolic names for addresses. (-S)
20031002	Fixing the i/d fake cache for R2000/R3000. It's still
		just an ugly hack, though.
		Fixing minor bugs to make the 3100 emulation use the
		dc device (serial console) correctly. So far, 5100 and
		3100 are the only ones that get far enough to print
		stuff, when booting NetBSD.
20031004	Adding skeleton Cobalt machine emulation (-E).
		Adding a dummy ns16550 serial controller, used by the
		Cobalt machine emulation.
20031006	Adding unaligned load/store instructions (lwl, lwr,
		ldl, ldr, swl, swr, sdl, sdr), although they are not
		tested yet.
		Fixed a "data modified on freelist" bug when running
		NetBSD/cobalt: setting the top bit of the index register
		when a tlbp fails (as the R4000 manual says) isn't
		sufficient, I had to clear the low bits as well.
		Adding break and syscall instructions, but they are not
		tested yet.
		Adding a 'gt' device, faking a PCI bus, for the Cobalt
		emulation.
20031008	Adding initial support for HPCmips (-F), a framebuffer
		device using X11. NetBSD/hpcmips can output pixels to
		the framebuffer, but that's about it.
20031009	Fixing the NetBSD/pmax bug: the "0/tftp/netbsd" style
		bootstring was only passed correctly in the bootinfo
		block, it needs to be passed as argv[0] as well.
		Adding instructions: mtlo, mthi.
		Rearrangning the source tree layout.
		Adding console input functionality. The NetBSD/cobalt
		kernel's ddb can now be interacted with.
20031010	Adding experimental (semi-useless) -t option, to show
		a function call tree while a program runs.
		Linux/cobalt now prints a few messages, but then hangs
		at "Calibrating delay loop..." unless an ugly hack is
		used (setting a word of memory at 0x801e472c to non-zero).
20031013	Adding a framebuffer device used in DECstation 3100;
		VFB01 for mono is implemented so far, not yet the
		VFB02 (color) variant.  Rewriting the framebuffer
		device so that it is usable by both HPCmips and DECstation
		emulation.
20031014	Minor fixes. Everything should compile and run ok
		both with and without X11.
20031015	Adding support for ECOFF binary images; text, data,
		and symbols are loaded. (Playing around with ultrixboot
		and ultrix kernels.)
20031016	The DECstation argv,argc stuff must be at 0xa0000000,
		not 0x80000000, or Ultrix kernels complain.
		Adding R2000/R3000 'rfe' instruction.
		Implementing more R2K/R3K tlb specific stuff, so that
		NetBSD boots and uses the tlb correctly, but much of
		it is ugly. (Needs to be separated in a cleaner way.)
		ECOFF symbols sizes are now calculated, so that offsets
		within symbols are usable.
20031017	DECstation bootstrings now automatically include the
		correct name of the kernel that is booting.
		Ultrix boots a bit.
20031018	ELF symbols are now read automatically from the binary.
		-t trace looks a bit better (string arguments are shown).
		Trying to get initial R5900 stuff working (the 128-bit
		CPU used in Playstation 2).
		Fixing a minor bug to make the VFB02 (color framebuffer)
		device work better, but it is still just 256 grayscales,
		not real color. Ultrix can now use the framebuffer (it
		calls it PMAX-CFB).
		A machine can now consist of CPUs of different types.
		Adding instructions: daddi, mov_xxx, mult_xx. The xxx
		instructions are not documented MIPS64 instructions,
		but NetBSD/playstation2 uses them. Perhaps VR5432
		instructions?
		Adding sign-extension to 32-bit mult.
		Adding Playstation 2 devices: dmac (DMA controller),
		gs (Graphic something?), and gif (graphics something
		else, which has access to the PS2's framebuffer).
		NetBSD/playstation2 works a bit, and prints a few
		bootup messages.
20031020	The cpu_type field of the cpu struct now contains
		usable values in a much better form than before. This
		simplifies adding of new CPU types.
20031021	Fixing an interrupt related bug: pc_last was used, but
		for interrupts this was incorrect. Fixed now.
		Fixing a load/store related bug: if a load into a
		register was aborted due to an exception, the register
		was still modified.
		The mc146818 rtc now reads its time from the system's
		time() function.
		Fixing another exception bug: if loading an instruction
		caused an exception, something bogus happened as the
		emulator tried to execute the instruction anyway. This
		has been fixed now.
20031023	Adding a quick hack which skips "while (reg --) ;"
		kind of loops.
		NetBSD/pmax suddenly reached userland (!), but only
		once and attempts to repeat it have failed. I believe
		it is problems with my interrupt handling system.
20031024	Adding 8-bit color palette support to the framebuffer.
		Connecting the pmax vdac device to the framebuffer's
		rgb palette.
		Fixing a bug in the dc device, so that console input
		is possible; interaction with NetBSD/pmax's built-in
		kernel debugger works now.
		Symbol sizes for file formats where symbol size isn't
		included are now calculated regardless of file format.
		Physical memory space can now be smaller than 64 bits,
		improving emulation speed a bit.
		Doing other minor performance enhancements by moving
		around some statements in critical parts of the code.
20031025	Minor changes to the dc device.
20031026	Adding support for reading symbols directly from
		a.out files. (Works with OpenBSD/pmax binaries.)
		Hardware devices may now register "tick functions" at
		specific cycle intervals in a generic fashion.
		All four channels of the dc serial controller device
		should now work; playing around with keyboard scan
		code generation when using the DECstation framebuffer.
		Making various (speed) improvements to the framebuffer
		device.
20031027	Playing around with the sii SCSI controller.
20031028	Minor fixes.
		Adding an SGI emulation mode (-G), and some ARCBIOS
		stuff, which SGIs seem to use.
		Adding getbitmap() to the DEC prom emulation layer,
		so some more -D x models become more usable.
		Adding a dummy 'ssc' serial console device for
		DECsystem 5400 emulation.
		Playing around with TURBOchannel stuff.
20031030	Minor fixes.
		Adding the sub instruction. (Not tested yet?)
		Sign-extending the results of multu, addi,addiu,
		add,addu,sub,subu,mfcZ.
		Adding a colorplanemask device for DECstation 3100.
		Fixed the NetBSD/pmax bug: I had forgotten to reset
		asid_match to 0 between tlb entry checks. :-)  Now
		userland runs nicely...
20031031	Fixing more bugs:  unaligned load/store could fail
		because of an exception, but registers could be "half
		updated". This has been fixed now.  (As a result,
		NetBSD/pmax can now run with any of r2000,r3000,r4000,
		r4400, or r5000.)
		Adding some R5K and R10000 stuff.  (Note: R5K is NOT
		R5000. Weird.)
		Adding dummy serial console (scc) for MAXINE.
		MAXINE also works with framebuffer, but there is no
		color palette yet (only black and white output).
20031101	Moving code chunks around to increase performance by
		a few percent.
		The opcode statistics option (-s) now shows opcode
		names, and not just numbers. :-)
		Fixing the bug which caused NetBSD/pmax to refuse
		input in serial console mode, but not in keyboard/
		framebuffer mode: the osconsole environment variable
		wasn't set correctly.
		Adding DEC PROM getchar() call.
		The transmitter scanner of the dc device now scans
		all four channels at once, for each tick, so serial
		output is (approximately) 4 times faster.
20031103	Adding a dummy BT459 vdac device, which does nothing
		but allows a PMAG-BA turbochannel graphics card to be
		used as framebuffer.
		Several DECstation machines (-D 2, 3, and 4) can now
		use TURBOchannel option card framebuffers as console,
		for output. (Keyboard input is still not implemented
		for those models.)  Only PMAG-AA (1280x1024x8) and
		PMAG-BA (1024x864x8), both using BT459 vdac, have
		been tested so far.
		Modifying the X11 routines so that several framebuffer
		windows now can be used simultaneously (if several
		graphics option cards are to be emulated concurrently).
20031104	DEC MIPSMATE 5100 (KN230) interrupts are shared
		between devices. I've added an ugly hack to allow
		that to work, which makes it possible to boot NetBSD
		into userland with serial console.
20031106	Removing the -S (symbol) option, as symbol files can
		now be given in any order together with other file
		names to be loaded.
		cookin tipped me about using (int64_t) (int32_t)
		casts instead of manually sign-extending values.
		Casting sometimes increases performance, sometimes
		decreases. It's tricky.
		Importing mips64emul into CVS.
20031107	Adding a generic ARC emulation mode.
		Increasing performance of the framebuffer by not
		updating it (or the XImage) if a write to the
		framebuffer contains exactly what is already in it.
		(This improves scrolling speed and initialization.)
		Adding initial MIPS16 support.
		Adding initial disk image support (-d command line
		option), but this will not be used until I get some
		kind of SCSI-controller emulation working.
20031108	Adding the first MIPS16 instructions: "move y,X",
		"ld y,D(x)", and "daddiu S,K" (but the last one
		doesn't work yet).
		Fixing the console environment variable for
		Enough of the 'asc' controller is now implemented
		to let NetBSD get past scsi disk detection when
		no disk images are used.
		DECstation machine type 2; both serial console and
		graphical console work now.
		Other X-windows bit-depths than 24 bits work now,
		but colors are still not correct in non-24 bit modes.
		Keypresses in X framebuffer windows are now
		translated into console keypresses. (Normal keys, but
		not cursor keys or other special keys.)
20031111	Adding support for X11 using non-24-bit output.
20031120	Adding X11 mouse event to emulated mouse event
		translation, but it's not tested yet.
		Trying to get more of the SCSI controller emulation
		to work.
20031124	Raw binaries can now be loaded into memory.
20031204	Adding srec binary support.
20031220	Adding some super-ugly arcbios emulation code.
		Making some progress on the SGI and ARC machine
		emulations.
20031222	SGI and ARC progress. Multiple CPUs are now added to
		the arcbios component tree (although NetBSD cannot
		actually use more than one).
20031228	Adding 'crime' and 'macepci' fake devices for SGI
		emulation.
		Finally implementing the cop0 'compare' register.
		Improvements to the ns16550 device, but it is still
		incomplete.
		SGI userland is now reached, but interaction is broken
		(due to the buggy ns16550).
20031229	Adding some more instructions: teq, dsllv
		Adding a Nintendo 64 emulation mode (skeleton).
		Adding R4300 and R12000 to the cpu list.
20031230	Adding bltzal, bltzall, bgezal, bgezall (not really
		tested yet).
		Fixing the 16550 serial controller device (by not
		supporting fifo, so in fact it emulates a 16450
		instead).  This causes NetBSD/sgimips to run nicely
		into userland, sysinst, and so on.
		Some ARC/RD94 interrupts seem to work ok now, but
		i/o interrupts are still not correctly implemented.
		NetBSD/arc userland is reached and can be interacted
		with, but there's no sysinst (?).
20040103	Trying to get some Irix stuff to work, but it's hard.
		Fixing some Cobalt/linux problems.
20040104	Adding a dummy 8250 device, so that Linux/sgimips can output
		console messages.
		Adding dmultu. (The same as dmult, so I'm not sure it's correct.
		Perhaps dmultu is correct and dmult is wrong...)
		Fixing a bug in unaligned load/stores of 64-bit values (a cast
		was needed).
		Linux/sgimips in 64-bit works a bit more than before.
		Adding simple (polled) input functionality to dev_zs.
		Making some progress on SGI-IP22 (IP32 still works best,
		though).
		Fixing the mc146818 clock device in ARC/NEC and SGI emulation
		modes, the year field was not correct.
		Adding a fake 'pref' instruction (lwc3).
20040106	Separating out memory.h from misc.h.
		Refactoring of a lot of small code fragments.
		The PCI bus device is now shared between Cobalt, SGI, and ARC.
		Support for RAM mirroring (dev_ram.c, not really tested yet).
		Ugly hack to select the largest of ELF string symbol tables,
		if there are more than one.
		Memory hole fix for ARCBIOS, and a fix for very large (>= 4GB)
		amounts of emulated RAM.
		TGA (DEC 21030) PCI graphics device. NetBSD/arc can boot with
		this card and use it as a framebuffer console.
20040107	Adding a fix (partly incorrect) to daddi, to allow Linux/sgimips
		to boot in 64-bit mode.
20040108	Fixing a sll/nop bug (rd==0 for nop, not sa==0 as before).
20040109	Trying to get an SGI-IP32 PROM image to boot.
20040110	Faking R10000 cache things.
		The PROM image boots, although it takes almost forever for it
		to realize that there is no keyboard.
		The 'gbe' SGI-IP32 graphics device works enough to display the
		Linux framebuffer penguin in the upper left corner :-)
20040111	-p and -P addresses can now be given as symbol names, not just
		numeric values.
		Experimenting with adding a PCIIDE (dev_wdc) controller to the
		Cobalt emulation.
20040120	Adding src/bintrans.c. No code yet, but this is a place for
		ideas to be written down.
		Increasing performance a little bit by inlining the check for
		interrupts (which occurs for every instruction).
20040124	Experimenting with pure userland (syscall) emulation.
20040127	Fixes for compiling under Solaris.
20040206	Some bintrans experiments.
20040209	Adding some simple Ultrix userland emulation syscalls.
20040211	Adding decprom_dump_txt_to_bin.c to the experiments/ dir.
		Adding a section to doc/ on how to use DECstation PROM dumps.
		Adding a hello world example to doc/ as well.
20040218	TURBOchannel slots that are empty now return a DBE exception,
		so that Ultrix and DECstation PROMs don't complain about
		broken TURBOchannel ROMs.
		Working some more on the machine-dependant interrupt stuff.
20040219	Trying out some Linux/DECstation kernels (semi-successfully).
20040222	YES! I finally found the bug that caused Linux/SGI-IP32 to only
		work on Alpha, not on 32-bit machines.  It was a shift left,
		probably done using 6 bits on alpha, 5 bits on 32-bit machines.
20040223	Some minimal DEC KN5800 progress; Ultrix prints some boot
		messages, detects 16 XMI R3000 cpus, and get a NULL panic.
		It's all fake, though, the CPUs don't actually work.
		Still, better than nothing :-)
20040225	An Ultrix OSF1 kernel with a ramdisk now boots :-)  (It was
		a problem with ultrixboot not giving the same arguments as
		NetBSD's boot program.)
20040225(later)	Fixing a bug in the DECstation dc serial device; digits 0-9
		were translated to numeric keypad 0-9, not the normal 0-9.
		(This caused Ultrix to print escape sequences instead of
		digits.)
20040226	Some progress on machine-dependant interrupt delivery
		for -D7 (Maxine) and -D4, and some more 'scc' serial
		controller featuers are implemented (but no interrupts/
		dma/keyboard/mouse stuff yet).
20040228	Progress on the scc controller; -D4 works in both serial
		console mode and with keyboard (graphical console), but no
		mouse yet.
20040301	SGI mace interrupts are now done using the new machine-
		independant interrupt system.
20040303	Fixing an R5900 bug; the lowest 6 bits have special meaning
		for coprocessor functions, not just 5 bits as on non-R5900
		CPUs. (This fixes a bug which caused NetBSD to crash.)
20040304	Adding enough (fake) DMA capabilities to the ioasic device
		to allow Ultrix to print boot messages in the -D3, -D4,
		and -D7 modes, and also print graphical console messages
		in -D4 and -D7 modes.
		-D11 (DEC5500) polled getchar added (to the 'ssc' device).
		Adding the 'madd' instruction (including R5900 weird stuff).
20040304(later)	Playstation 2's GIF can now copy 640x16 pixel chunks, allowing
		NetBSD to scroll up the framebuffer.  The cursor also works
		better now.
		Playstation 2 bootinfo RTC data should now be passed correctly
		to the running kernel.
		DECstation rtc year should be either 72 or 73, anything else
		will cause Ultrix to give a warning about invalid year.
20040306	Combining playstation2's dmac, interrupt, and timer devices
		into one (ps2_stuff).
		Adding some R5900 instructions: mfsa, mtsa, pmfhi, pmflo, por,
		lq, and sq.  (Most of them are just guesses, though.)
		Implementing my own XImage putpixel routine, which can be
		inlined... significantly faster than normal XPutPixel. :-)
20040307	Implementing the basic functionality of a "PMAG-CA" pixelstamp
		accellerated framebuffer device. Works with NetBSD and
		Ultrix, but no cursor or color support.
20040308	PMAG-CA, -DA, and -FA pixelstamps seem to work now.
		Adding a hack to allow a pmax/mach kernel to be loaded (it's
		a COFF file with 0 (!) sections).
		Initial test of bt459 + framebuffer cursor support.
20040309	Fixes/updates of dev_dec5800 and dev_ssc (and dev_decxmi) allow
		a KN5800 Ultrix-OSF1-ramdisk kernel to boot all the way into
		userland and be interacted with.
		The bt459 cursor should now look semi-nice, but it is still
		a bit fake.
20040310	Moving the DEC CCA stuff from src/machine.c into a separate
		device file (devices/dev_deccca.c).
		An ugly hack added to allow some more OSF/1 kernels (almost
		a.out, but without many of the header fields) to load.
20040314	Adding PMAG-JA and PMAG-RO (1280x1024 x 8-bit) TURBOchannel
		graphics devices. They work in Ultrix, but only monochrome
		and no cursor, because there are no ramdacs or such yet.
20040315	Pixelstamp solid fill now supports colors other than just
		zero-fill.
		Adding a (new) regression test skeleton.
20040321	Some really minor updates.
20040323	Fixes to allow SGI-IP20 and IP22 to work a bit better
		(aliased memory), and adding "private" firmware-like vectors
		to arcbios emul. An IP22 Irix kernel gets far enough to
		print an assertion warning (and then double panics). :-)
20040324	Adding a generalization hack to the SCC serial controller
		to work with SGI-IP19 (in addition to DECstations).
		Adding the 'sdc1' instruction.
		Some progress on various SGI emulation modes.
20040325	Minor updates.
20040326	Fixed a 'madd' bug (r5900). NetBSD/playstation2 now reaches
		userland correctly.  And a simple fix which allows NetBSD
		timer interrupts to be triggered; NetBSD uses T_MODE_CMPE
		(compare), while Linux uses _OVFE (overflow).
20040328	Linux on Playstation 2 boots a bit. The Playstation 2
		graphics controller has been extended to work better with
		NetBSD, and to include some Linux support as well.
		Some interrupt handling enhancements on Playstation 2,
		needed for Linux' dma.
		128-bit loads and stores (lq and sq) are allowed, although
		the top half of quadwords are not modified by other
		instructions. (Linux uses lq and sq.)
		Big-endian X Windows servers now display correct rgb color,
		not bgr as before.
20040330	Some minor updates to the documentation.
20040401	Adding a dummy ps2 OHCI device.
20040402	Progress on the asc SCSI controller.
20040406	Hack to allow ./configure, make to work on HP-UX B.11.00
		on HPPA-RISC, gcc 3.3.2. (Does not work with HP's cc.)
		More progress on the asc SCSI controller. Fixing INQUIRY,
		adding READ_CAPACITY, adding READ. Works a bit with NetBSD
		and some (but not all) Ultrix kernels, on DECstation type 2.
		Adding WRITE, SYNCRONIZE_CACHE.
		Mounting disks works in NetBSD :-)  It is a bit buggy,
		though. Or something else is buggy.
20040407	The bug is triggered by gunzip during NetBSD/pmax install.
20040408	Fixing a bug (non-nul-terminated string) which caused X11
		cursors to not display on Solaris.
		Unnecessary X11 redraws are skipped (removes some weird
		delays that existed before), and cursors are redrawn on
		window exposure. (The cursor functionality has been moved
		from dev_fb.c to x11.c.)
20040411	Fixing the DC7085 device so that Ultrix doesn't behave weird
		if both tx and rx interrupts occur at the same time.
		More advancements on the asc SCSI controller.
		More disk image filename prefixes are now recognized; c (for
		CD-ROM, as before), d for disk, b for boot device, r for
		read-only, and 0-7 for scsi id.
		Mounting disks works in Ultrix. Installing to disk usually
		crashes for various reasons, but an OSF/1 install gets
		relatively far (similar to the NetBSD/pmax install).
20040412	Trying to find the bug.
20040415	Finally found and fixed the bug; SCSI reads and writes
		(actually, any data in or data out) can be split up into
		multiple DMA transfers. That stuff was only partially
		implemented, and the part that was implemented was buggy.
		It works now. NetBSD/pmax and Ultrix 4.3 seems to like
		the SCSI stuff enough to install almost all the way.
20040415 (more)	Adding a hack which allows a host's cdrom device to be used as
		a cdrom device inside the emulator, eg /dev/cd0c.
		Making the cycle counter int64_t instead of long, as a 'long'
		overflows too easily on 32-bit machines. (The bug is still
		there, though.)
		I've now verified that a full NetBSD/pmax install can be done.
		If using a PMAG-AA graphics board, startx brings up X :-)
		mips64emul can be compiled inside NetBSD inside mips64emul,
		and it can run NetBSD in that environment. (I'm getting
		dizzy... :-)
20040417	Moving some coprocessor stuff from cpu.c to coproc.c.
20040424	Adding a BT455 vdac for PMAG-AA. Black and white are now
		rendered correctly in Xpmax.
		Adding colormap support to the BT459 device, for PMAG-BA.
20040425	Fixing a buffer length bug, which caused an Ultrix 4.5
		install to bug out on an i386 host.
20040429	FPU experiments.
20040502	More FPU experiments.
		Speedup for exception debug messages:  in quiet mode, debug
		messages were still evaluated, which took a relatively
		large amount of time.
20040503	Most FPU stuff fixed, but there is at least one known bug
		left; ps axu in NetBSD triggers it (ps loops forever).
20040504	A default install of Ultrix 4.5 succeeded! It boots up with
		a graphical login.
		Fixing the keyboard repetition bug (a lk201 "up" (release)
		scancode is now sent after every key).
20040505	Both CR and LF now produce the same lk201 scancode, so that
		pressing 'enter' works as expected in Ultrix.
20040506	Adding a vaddr to paddr translation cache, causing a speedup
		of perhaps 50% or more.
20040507	Fixing PMAG-BA color for Ultrix. (Ultrix relies on interrupts
		coming from the TURBOchannel slot to update the palette.)
20040508	Fixing cursor positioning for PMAG-BA.
20040511	Prints current nr of instructions per seconds, not only
		average, when using -N.
20040515	Some more bintrans experiments.
20040606	Adding ARCBIOS GetReadStatus() and Read().
		Adding some instructions: tlt, tltu, tge, tgeu, tne.
20040607	Adding the dsub instruction.
		Some minimal progress on SGI-IP30 emulation.
		Applying a patch from Juli Mallett to src/file.c (I'm not
		sure yet if it breaks or fixes anything).
		Some minor fixes for SGI-IP22 (such as faked board revision
		numbers).
20040608	ll/sc should now fail if any unrelated load/store occurs.
		Minor changes to the configure script.
		Adding some ifdefs around code which is not often used
		(the mfhi/mflo delay, and the last_used TLB experimental
		code); this might cause a tiny speedup.
20040609	Minor fixes.
20040610	Various minor SGI fixes (64-bit ARCS stuff, progress on the
		CRIME/MACE interrupt system, and some other random things).
20040611	More crime/mace progress, and some more work on pckbc.
		KN5800 progress: adding a XMI->BI adapter device; a disk
		controller is detected (but it is just a dummy so far).
20040612	Adding "dev_unreadable", which simplifies making memory
		areas unreadable. (NetBSD on SGI-IP22 no longer detects
		non-existant hpc1 and hpc2 busses.)
		Implementing rudimentary support for IP22 "local0" and
		"local1" interrupts, and "mappable" local interrupts.
		Some progress on the WDSC SCSI controller on IP22, enough
		to let NetBSD get past the disk detection and enter
		userland!  :-)
		The zs (zilog serial) device now works well enough to let
		NetBSD/sgimips be interacted with on IP22. :-)  (Though
		it is very ugly and hardcoded.)
20040613	IP32 didn't work last night, because there were too many
		tick functions registered. That has been increased now.
		Trying out NetBSD/sgimips 2.0 beta kernels. There are some
		differences compared to 1.6.2, which I'm trying to solve.
		Interrupt fixes for IP32: _serial and _misc are different.
		Separation of IP22 (Full-house) and IP24 (Guiness).
20040614	Modifying the memory layout for IP20,22,24,26 (RAM is now
		offset by 128MB, leaving room for EISA registers and such),
		and moving around some code chunks. This is not well
		tested yet, but seems to work.
		Moving parts of the tiny translation cache, as suggested
		by Juli Mallett.  It seems that the speedup isn't as
		apparent as it was a few weeks ago, though. :-(
		Speedups due to not translating addresses into symbol
		names unless the symbol name is actually printed.
		Added support for loading old big-endian (Irix) ECOFF
		kernels (0x60 0x01 as the first two bytes).
20040615 (late)	Adding enough SGI IP20 (Indigo) support to let NetBSD 2.0
		enter userland :-)  No interrupt specifics are implemented
		yet, so it hangs while doing terminal output.
20040618	Experimenting with the WDSC SCSI controller for IP20,22,24.
20040620	Adding a program which converts SGI prom dumps from text
		capture to binary, and some hacks to try to make such an
		IP22 PROM to work better in the emulator.
20040621	Removing the Nintendo 64 emulation mode, as it is too
		uninteresting to support.
		Adding SCSI tape device support (read-only, so far).
		Fixing a bug which caused the cursor to be corrupted if new
		data was written to the framebuffer, but the cursor wasn't
		moved.
20040622(early)	Finally! Making progress on the SCSI tape stuff; when going
		past the end of a file, automagically switch to the beginning
		of the next.
20040622(late)	Trying to track down the last SCSI tape bugs.
		Removing _all_ dynamic binary translation code (bintrans),
		starting from scratch again.
20040623(early)	Performing a general code cleanup (comments, fixing stuff
		that led to compiler warnings, ...).
		Disabling MIPS16 support by default, and making it a
		configure time option to enable it (--mips16). This gives
		a few percent speed increase overall.
		Increasing performance by assuming that instruction loads
		(reading from memory) will be at the same page as the last
		load.  (Several percent speedup.)
		Moving the list of kernels that can be found on the net from
		README to doc/.
20040624	Finally! I found and fixed the bug which caused 'ps', 'top',
		'xclock', and other programs in NetBSD/pmax to behave weird.
		Increasing performance by a few percent by running as many
		instructions in a row as possible, before checking for
		hardware ticks.
		When booting from SCSI tapes on DECstation, the bootstring
		now contains 'tz' instead of 'rz'.
		Adding a second ARC machine mode, "Acer PICA-61", -A2.
		Disabling the support for "instruction delays" by default
		(it has to be enabled manually in misc.h now, but is never
		used anywhere anyway).
		Other minor optimizations (moving around stuff in the
		cpu struct in misc.h, and caching cpu->pc in cpu.c).
		Separating the tiny translation cache into two, one for
		code and one for data. This gives a few percent speed
		increase.
20040625(early)	I think now is a good time for a "feature freeze",
		to let the code stabilize and then make some kind of
		first release.
20040625(later)	Adding a -v (verbose) command line option. If -v is not
		specified, the emulator goes into -q (quiet) mode just before
		it starts to execute MIPS code.
20040627	The configure script now adds -fomit-frame-pointer to the
		compile flags if the $CC seems to be able to handle that.
		Found and fixed a serious interrupt bug in BT459 (Ultrix'
		behaviour required a hack, which was incorrect), so
		performance for machines using the PMAG-BA framebuffer is
		now improved.
		For X11 bitdepths other than 8 or 24, a warning message
		is printed at startup.
		A number of other minor fixes, optimizations, updated
		comments and so on.
		Adding a BUGS file, a list of known bugs.
		Adding a minimal man page, doc/mips64emul.1.
20040628	Hacks for faking the existance of a second level cache
		(ARCBIOS and other places).
		An important fix for dc7085: tx interrupts should happen
		before rx interrupts, not the other way around as it was
		before. (This speeds up NetBSD boot on DECstation, and
		fixes a bug which Ultrix triggered on heavy keyboard input.)
		A couple of other minor fixes.
		Framebuffer fix: there was a bug which caused the rightmost/
		bottom pixel to sometimes not be updated, when running in
		scaledown mode. This is now fixed.
		Adding a small program which removes "zero holes" from
		harddisk image files.
20040629	More minor fixes.
20040629(later)	Adding -A3 (NEC RISCstation 2200) (this is similar to
		the 2250 model that NetBSD/arc can already boot all the
		way into userland and be interacted with), and -A4
		(Deskstation Tyne).
		Some more minor fixes.
20040630	Adding support for 15 and 16 bits X11 framebuffers,
		and converting from XYPixmap to ZPixmap (this fixes the
		problem of updates appearing in "layers" on some X
		servers).
		The pixels in the mouse cursor (for BT459) are now colored
		as the emulated OS sets them, although no transparency
		masking is done on the edges of the cursor yet. (In plain
		English:  the mouse cursor is no longer just a white solid
		square, you can actually see the mouse cursor image
		on the white square.)

==============  RELEASE 0.1  ==============

20040701	The -j option now takes a name, the of the kernel as passed
		on to the bootloader.  ("netbsd" is the default name.)
		Adding support to load bootstrap code directly from a disk
		image, for DECstation.  Both NetBSD/pmax and Ultrix boot
		straight of a disk image now, with no need to supply a
		kernel filename on the command line.  (Ultrix still needs
		-j vmunix, though, to boot from /vmunix instead of /netbsd.)
20040702	Minor bugfix (some new untested code for X11 keypresses was
		incorrect).
20040702(later)	Adding an ugly hack for CDROMs in FreeBSD; if an fread() isn't
		done at a 2048-byte aligned offset, it will fail. The hack
		tries to read at 2048-byte aligned offsets and move around
		buffers to make it work.
		Adding video off (screen blanking) support to BT459.

==============  RELEASE 0.1.1  ==============

20040702(later)	Cleanup to remove compiler warnings (Compaq's cc, Solaris' cc,
		and gcc 3.3.3/3.3.4 in Linux), mostly by putting ULL on large
		numeric constants.
		Better support for scaledown of BT459 cursors, but still not
		color-averaging.
		Beginning the work on adding better memory latency support
		(instruction delays), enabled by the --delays configure option.
20040703	Modifications to the configure script so that a config.h file
		is created, containing things that were passed along as
		-Dxxx on each cc command line before.
		More work on instruction latency support; trying to separate
		the concepts of nr of cycles and nr of instructions.
20040704	Working on R2000/R3000 caches.
		Adding a '--caches' option to the configure script.
		Various small optimizations.
		R3000 caches finally work. (I know that there is at least one
		bug, regarding interrupt response.)
20040705	Working on the 'le' device, and on a generic (device
		independant) networking framework. le can transmit and receive
		packets, and the network framework fakes ARP responses from a
		fake gateway machine (at a fixed ip address, 10.0.0.254).
		Adding a '-c' command line option, which makes emulated_hz
		automatically adjust itself to the current number of emulated
		cycles per host CPU second (measured at regular intervals).
20040707	Removing the '-c' option again, and making it the default
		behaviour of the emulator to automatically adjust clock
		interrupts to runtime speed (as long as it is above 1 MHz).
		(This can be overridden by specifying a static clock rate with
		the -I option.)
		Updating the doc/ stuff a bit.
		Generalization of the DECstation bootblock loading, to work
		with Sprite/pmax. Lots of other minor modifications to make
		Sprite work, such as adding support for DECstation "jump table"
		PROM functions, in addition to the old callback functions.
		Sprite boots from a disk image, starting the kernel if the
		argument "-j vmsprite" is used, but it seems to not like the
		DBE exceptions caused by reading empty TURBOchannel slots. :-/
20040708	Minor changes and perhaps some tiny speed improvements.
		The Lance chip is (apparently) supposed to set the length of
		received packets to len+4. (I've not found this in any 
		documentation, but this is what NetBSD expects.) So now, ICMP
		echo replies work :-)  UDP works in the outgoing direction,
		in the incoming direction, tcpdump can see the packets but they
		seem to be ignored anyway. (Weird.)
		Adding a separate virtual-address-to-host-page translation
		cache, 1-entry for loads, 1-entry for stores. (For now, it
		only works on R4000 as there are conflicts with cache usage
		on R3000).
		Changing the lower clock speed bound from 1 MHz to 1.5 MHz.
20040709	Incoming UDP checksums were wrong, but are now set to zero
		and NetBSD inside the emulator now accepts the packets (eg.
		nameserver responses).  Host lookups and even tftp file
		transfers (using UDP) work now :-)
		Adding a section on Networking to the Technical documentation,
		and a preliminary NetBSD/pmax install instruction for network
		installs to the User documentation.
		Some updates to the man page.
20040709(later)	Fix to the TURBOchannel code to allow Sprite to get past the
		card detection. Seems to still work with Ultrix and NetBSD.
		This also makes Linux/DECstation properly recognize both the
		Lance controller and the SCSI controller. Linux 2.4.26 from
		Debian boots nicely in framebuffer mode :-)
20040710	Some bits in the KN02 CSR that were supposed to be readonly
		weren't. That has been fixed, and this allows Linux/DECstation
		to get past SCSI detection. :-)
		Minor updates to the ASC controller, which makes Linux and
		OpenBSD/pmax like the controller enough to be able to access
		SCSI devices. OpenBSD/pmax boots from a disk image for the
		first time. :-)  Linux detects SCSI disks, but I have no
		bootable Linux diskimage to test this with.
		Updating the doc/ to include instructions on how to install
		OpenBSD/pmax onto a disk image.
		Naively added a PMAGB-BA (1280x1024x8) in hopes that it would
		basically be a PMAG-BA (1024x864x8) in higher resolution,
		but it didn't work that way. I'll have to look into this later.
		Adding a -o option, useful for selecting '-s' (single user
		mode) during OpenBSD install and other things.
		After a lot of debugging, a serious bug related to the tiny
		cache was found; Linux just changes the ASID and returns when
		switching between processes in some occasions without actually
		_writing_ to the TLB, and I had forgotten to invalidate the
		tiny cache on such a change.
20040711(early)	I've been trying to repeat the OpenBSD install from yesterday,
		but appart from the first initial install (which was
		successful), I've only been able to do one more. Several
		attempts have failed with a filesystem panic in the middle
		of install. I'm not sure why.
20040711	I found the "bug": wget downloaded the simpleroot28.fs.gz file
		as read-only, and gunzip preserved those flags. Thus, OpenBSD's
		installer crashed as it didn't get its writes through to the
		disk.
		Parts of the 1280x1024x8 PMAGB-BA graphics card has been
		implemented, it works (unaccelerated) in NetBSD and OpenBSD,
		but Ultrix does not seem to like it.
		Cleaned up the BT459 cursor offset stuff a bit.
		Trying to make the emulated mouse coordinates follow the host's
		mouse' coordinates (for lk201, DECstation), by
		"de-accelerating" the data sent to the emulated OS.
20040711(later)	Fix so that Sprite detects the PMAG-BA correctly.
		Adding some stuff about NFS via UDP to the documentation.
		Fixed the 'update flag' for seconds, so now Sprite doesn't
		crash because of timer-related issues anymore.
		Fixing KN02 interrupt masks a bit more, to make Sprite not
		crash. Sprite now runs quite well.
20040712	Working on IP/UDP fragementation issues. Incoming UDP packets
		from the outside world can now be broken up into fragments
		for the guest OS. (This allows, for example, OpenBSD/pmax to
		be installed via nfs.)  Outgoing fragmented packets are NOT
		yet handled.
		Linux doesn't use 64-bit file offsets by default, which is
		needed when using large disk images (more than 2GB), so the
		configure script has now been modified to add necessary
		compiler flags for Linux.
20040713	Trying out some minor optimizations.
		Refreshing the UDP implementation in src/net.c a little.
20040714	Updating the documentation a little on how to experiment
		with a Debian Linux install kernel for DECstations.
		A 'mini.iso' Linux image for DECstation has different fields
		at offsets 0x10 and 0x14, so I'm guessing that the first is
		the load address and the second is the initial PC value.
		Hopefully this doesn't break anything.
		Some initial TCP hacks, but not much is working yet.
		Some updates for IP30:  The load/store 1-entry cache didn't
		work too well with IP30 memory, so it's only turned on for
		"MMU4K" now. (This needs to be fixed some better way.)
		Adding a hack which allows Linux/Octane to use ARC write()
		and getchild() on IP30. Linux uses ARCBIOS_SPB_SIGNATURE as a
		64-bit field, it was 32-bit before.
		Making ugly hacks to the arcbios emulation to semi-support
		64-bit equivalents of 32-bit structures.
20040716	Minor fixes to the configure script (and a few other places)
		to make the sources compile out-of-the-box on HP-UX (ia64
		and HPPA), old OpenBSD/pmax (inside the emulator itself), and
		Tru64 (OSF/1) on Alpha.
		A couple of other minor fixes.
20040717	A little TCP progress; OpenBSD/pmax likes my SYN+ACK replies,
		and tries to send out data, but NetBSD/pmax just drops the
		SYN+ACK packets.
		Trial-and-error led me to change the 64-bit ARCS component
		struct again (Linux/IP30 likes it now). I'm not sure about all 
		of the offsets yet, but some things seem to work.
		More 64-bit ARCS updates (memory descriptors etc).
		Better memory offset fix for IP30, similar to how I did it for
		IP22 etc. (Hopefully this doesn't break anything else.)
		Adding a MardiGras graphics controller skeleton for SGI-IP30
		(dev_sgi_mardigras.c).
		Thanks to Stanislaw Skowronek for dual-licensing mgras.h.
		Finally rewrote get_symbol_name() to O(log n) instead of O(n)
		(Stanislaw's Linux kernel had so many symbols that tracing
		with the old get_symbol_name() was unbareably slow).
		Removing all of the experimental tlbmod tag optimization code
		(the 1-entry load/store cache), as it causes more trouble than
		the performance gain was worth.
20040718	The MardiGras device works well enough to let Linux draw the
		SGI logo and output text.
		A bunch of other minor changes.
20040719	Trying to move out all of the instruction_trace stuff from the
		main cpu loop (for two reasons: a little performance gain,
		and to make it easier to add a GUI later on).
20040720	Finally found and fixed the ethernet/tcp bug. The hardware
		address is comprised of 6 bytes, where the _first_ byte should
		have a zero as the lowest bit, not the last byte. (This causes
		NetBSD and Linux running in the emulator to accept my SYN+ACK
		packets.)
		Getting the first nameserver address from /etc/resolv.conf.
		(This is not used yet, but could be useful if/when I add
		internal DHCP support.)
		Working more on the TCP stuff; TCP seems to be almost working,
		the only immediate problem left is that the guest OS gets
		stuck in the closing and last-ack states, when it shouldn't.
		It is now possible to install NetBSD and OpenBSD via ftp. :-)
20040721	Trying to fix the last-ack bug, by sending an RST after the
		end of a connection. (Probably not a correct fix, but seems
		to work?)
		Adding a my_fseek() function, which works like fseek() but
		with off_t instead of long, so that large disk images can
		be used on systems where long is 32 bits.
20040722	Trying to fix some more TCP related bugs.
20040725	Changing the inlined asm statement in bintrans_alpha.c into
		a call to a hardcoded array of bytes that do the same thing
		(an instruction cache invalidation). This allows the same
		invalidation code to be used regardless of compiler.
		Some other minor changes.
20040726	Minor updates. The configure script is now more verbose.
		A Debian/IP22 Linux tftp boot kernel requires ARCS memory to
		be FreeMemory, not FreeContiguous. (This should still work with
		other SGI and ARC OSes.)
		Fix for ARCS write(), so it returns good write count and
		success result (0).
		Some hacks to the IP22 memory controller, to fake 72MB RAM
		in bank 0.
		The IP22 Debian kernel reaches userland (ramdisk) when run
		with -G24 -M72 -CR4400, if a special hack is done to the
		zs device.
20040730	Removing mgras.h, as I'm not sure a file dual-licensed this way
		would work. (Dual-licensing as two separate files would work
		though.)
		Preparing for the upcoming release (0.2).
20040801	Fixing the 512 vs 2048 cdrom sector size bug; I hadn't 
		implemented the mode select SCSI command. (It still isn't
		really implemented.)
		A bug which crashes the emulator is triggered when run with
		new NetBSD 2.0_BETA snapshots on a Linux/i386 host. I'm not
		sure why.
		UDP packets sent to the gateway (at 10.0.0.254) are now
		forwarded to the machine that the host uses as its nameserver.
		Some other minor fixes.

==============  RELEASE 0.2  ==============

20040803	A post-3.5 OpenBSD/sgimips kernel snapshot with ramdisk seems
		to boot fine in the emulator, all the way to userland, and
		can be interacted with.
		Adding a -y option, used to set how many (random) instructions
		to run from each CPU at max (useful for SMP instruction
		interleave experiments).
		Importing a 8x16 console font from FreeBSD (vt220l.816).
		Adding a skeleton for a 80x25 text console device (dev_vga),
		useful for some ARC modes. (Character output is possible, but
		no cursor yet.)
		Adding a dev_zero device (returns zeroes on read).
		OpenBSD/arc 2.3 can get all the way to userland with -A4 (if
		the wdc devices are commented out) but bugs out there, probably
		because of interrupt issues.
		Adding a -A5 ARC emulation mode (Microsoft-Jazz, "MIPS Magnum")
		which NetBSD seems to like. No interrupt specifics yet, so
		it hangs while waiting for SCSI.
20040804	Some dev_mp updates.
		The -y switch has to do with number of cycles, not number
		of instructions; variable names have been changed to reflect
		this.
20040805	Minor updates. Adding some more CPU types/names, but they
		are probably bogus.
		Adding a MeshCube emulation mode. Just a skeleton so far, but
		enough to let a Linux kernel print some boot messages.
		Adding the 'deret' instruction.
20040806	Adding include/impactsr-bsd.h (a newer version of what was in
		mgras.h before, and this time with only a BSD-style license),
		but it is not used yet.
20040810	Some Au1500 updates.
20040811	Adding the 'clz', 'clo', 'dclz', and 'dclo' special2 (MIPS32
		and MIPS64) instructions.
		More Au1500 updates.
20040812	Using fseeko(), when it is available.
		Other minor updates.
		Adding a NetGear WG602 emulation mode skeleton (-g); after
		a lot of trial and error, a Linux kernel (WG602_V1715.img)
		gets all the way to userland, but hangs there.
20040818	Adding signal handlers to better cope with CTRL-Z and CTRL-C.
		Adding a simple interactive single-step debugger which is
		activated by CTRL-C. (Commands so far: continue, dump, help,
		itrace, quit, registers, step, trace, version)
20040818(later)	Adding a 'tlbdump' debugger command, and some other minor
		fixes.
20040819	Minor updates. Adding an 'unassemble' debugger command.
20040822	Minor updates to the regression testing framework.
20040824	Minor updates based on feedback from Alec Voropay
		(configure script updates for Cygwin and documentation).
20040826	Minor updates.
		Adding a cursor to the VGA text console device.
		Changing all old 11:22:..55:66 ethernet macs to 10:20..60,
		still hardcoded though.
20040828	Minor updates.
20040829	mips64emul is 1 year old today :-)
20040901	tests/README now lists "all" MIPS opcodes. This list should
		be updated whenever a new opcode is implemented, or when a
		regression test is added. (A combination of instructions from
		the TX79 manual, the GNU assembler, and the MIPS64 manual).
		Hopefully I haven't missed too many.
		Adding a section on regression testing to doc/technical.html.
20040902	Finally beginning the work on separating out the stuff from
		main.c into a "struct emul". Very time-consuming.
		Some minor fixes for LL/SC on R10000.
20040905	Moving more stuff from main.c into struct emul. Unfortunately,
		it seems that this causes a slowdown of the emulator.
		Userland emulation is now only used if --userland is used
		when running configure.
		Modifying src/symbol.c to not use global variables.
20040906	Minor update.
20040914	Using $COPTIM when detecting which compiler flags to use in
		the configure script. (This makes sure that combinations of
		flags should work.)
		There'll probably be a 0.2.1 release some time soon, but I'll
		do some more clean-up first.
		Minor update to the detection of ECOFF files, but I don't like
		it; sometimes the endianness of the magic value seems to be
		swapped, but it doesn't have to do with endianness of the
		actual data?
20040916	Minor updates. Adding an Example section to the manpage, but
		as I'm not really familiar with manpage formatting, it will
		need to be rewritten later.
20040917	Finally making the coprocessor instructions disassemblable
		even when not running.
		Doing some testing for the 0.2.1 release.

==============  RELEASE 0.2.1  ==============

20040923	Updating the documentation about how to (try to) install
		Debian GNU/Linux.
20040924	Some more updates to the documentation.
20040925	Adding overflow stuff to 'add' and 'sub'.
20040926	Minor updates: possibly a fix to 'sltiu' (the imm value
		should be treated as signed, and then converted to unsigned,
		according to the MIPS64 manual), and removing the
		'last_was_rfe' stuff (again).
		OpenBSD/arc used speed-hack jumps with other deltas than just
		+/- 1 (it used -3 iirc), so the jump speedhack should now
		support any delta. Also adding bgtzl and blezl as possible
		instructions for the speed-hack jumps. (This needs to be
		tested more.)
20040928	Minor updates. Some ARC stuff ("arcdiag" runs now).
		cpu_register_dump() now also dumps coprocessor registers.
20040929	More ARC updates. Making the code look a tiny bit nicer
		than before. "arcdiag.ip22" works for -G22 (SGI-IP22).
		Apparently the overflow support in the 'add' instruction
		was incorrect, so I disabled it.
20041002	Trying to install Ultrix in the emulator, but the installer
		crashes; found (and fixed) the bug rather quickly: the "fix"
		I implemented a few days ago for the 'sub' instruction
		(according to the MIPS64 manual) caused the bug.
20041004	Changing the behaviour of the -j command line option. The
		default is now "" (or taken from the last filename given on
		the command line), not "netbsd". In practice, this doesn't
		change much, except that -j netbsd.pmax is no longer needed
		when installing NetBSD.
		Adding a COMPILE_DATE string to config.h.
20041007	Adding a NEC RISCserver 4200 model (-A6), and some more
		updates to the ARC component tree generator.
20041008	The 'll' instruction should be signed, not unsigned as before.
		This (and some other minor fixes) causes Irix on SGI-IP32 (O2)
		to actually boot far enough to print its first boot messages :)
		Working on some new dynamic bintrans code. Enough is now
		implemented so that the 'nop' instruction is translated
		and there is support for Alpha, i386 and UltraSparc backends,
		but performance is about 50% worse than when running without
		bintrans. (This is as expected, though.)
20041009	Minor updates to the documentation.
		Using mprotect() to make sure that the code created dynamically
		by the bintrans subsystem is allowed to be executed. (This
		affects newer OpenBSD systems, and possibly others.)
		The translated code chunks now only get one argument passed to
		them, the (struct cpu *) of the current cpu.
20041010	Hack to dev_le.c which makes Ultrix accept the initialization
		of the LANCE controller. (This goes against the LANCE
		documentation though.)
		In src/net.c, a fix for Ultrix (which seems to send larger
		ethernet packets than the actual TCP/IP contents). The hack to
		dev_le.c and this fix is enough to let Ultrix access the
		Internet.
		For DECstation, when booting without a disk image (or when
		"-O" is used on the command line), use "tftp" instead of "rzX"
		for the boot string.
20041011	Adding cache size variables to the emul struct, so that these
		can be set on a per-machine basis (or potentially manually
		on the command line).
20041012	Mach/PMAX now passes the LK201 keyboard self-test (although
		the keyboard ID is still bogus).
20041013	Minor updates.
		Hacks to the ASC SCSI controller for Mach/PMAX, hopefully this
		will not break support for other OSes.
20041014	Minor fix to src/emul.c for reading bootblocks at the end of
		a disk or cdrom image (thanks to Alexandru Lazar for making me
		aware of this).
		Adding "gets()" to src/dec_prom.c.
		Working a bit on ARC stuff. Importing pica.h from NetBSD.
		Minor updates to the ARC component tree for PICA-61.
		Adding a dev_jazz.c (mostly for PICA-61).
		Renaming dev_jazz.c into dev_pica.c. Working on PICA timer
		and interrupt specifics.
20041016	Adding some dummy entries to lk201.c to reduce debug output.
		Some bintrans updates (don't run in delay slots or nullified
		slots, read directly from host memory and not via memory_rw(),
		try mmap() before malloc() at startup, and many other minor
		updates).
		Adding bintrans_mips.c for 64-bit MIPS hosts, but it is not
		used yet.
20041017	Minor updates.
20041018	Update to dev_mc146818 to allow Mach to boot a bit further.
		The "hardware random" in dev_mp.c now returns up to 64 bits
		of random.
20041019	Minor updates to the way cache sizes are used throughout the
		code. Should be mostly ok for R[234]x00.
		src/file.c now loads files using NO_EXCEPTIONS. Whether this
		is good or bad, I'm not sure.
20041020	Adding a Linksys WRT54G emulation skeleton (-H).
20041021	Minor updates.
		R1[024]000 cache size bits in the config register should now
		be ok.
		Trying to make dev_asc.c work better with PICA.
		More work on PICA interrupts (but they are broken now).
20041022	Generalizing the dev_vga text console device so that it can be
		used in other resolutions than just 80x25. Works with
		OpenBSD/arc.
		emul->boot_string_argument is now empty by default (except
		for DECstation modes, where it is "-a").
		Speedup of dev_ram by using mmap() instead of malloc().
		Using mmap() in memory.c as well, which reduces memory usage
		when emulating large memory sizes if the memory isn't actually
		written to.
20041023	Minor updates.
20041024	Updates to the PC-style keyboard controller, used by PICA.
		Updates to the PICA (Jazz) interrupt system. Both NetBSD/arc
		and OpenBSD/arc now reach userland with PICA emulation, and
		can be interacted with (there are a few programs on the
		INSTALL kernel ramdisks). In the case of OpenBSD, a VGA text
		console and PC-style keyboard controller is used, NetBSD
		runs on serial console.
		Adding a framework for DMA transfer for the ASC SCSI
		controller.
		Implementing a R4030 DMA controller for PICA, enough to let
		OpenBSD/arc and NetBSD/arc be installed on an emulated
		Pica. :-)
		Updates to the documentation.
20041025	Working on ISA interrupts for PICA.
		Adding an Olivetti M700 emulation mode (-A7).
		Better separation of PICA and M700 stuff (which I accidentally
		mixed up before, I thought the M700 Linux kernel would 
		also work on PICA because it almost booted).
		Writing a skeleton G364 framebuffer for M700, enough to show
		the Linux penguin and some text, although scrolling isn't
		correctly implemented yet.
		Adding a dummy SONIC (ethernet) device, dev_sn, for PICA.
		Fixing the passing of OSLOADOPTIONS for ARC, the default is
		now "-aN" which works fine with OpenBSD/arc and NetBSD/arc.
20041027	Minor updates.
20041029	Adding a Sony NeWS "newsmips" emulation mode skeleton (-f).
		Found and fixed a bug which prevented Linux/IP32 from running
		(the speed-hack-jump-optimization fix I made a few weeks ago
		was buggy).
		Adding the trunc.w.fmt and trunc.l.fmt instructions, although
		the are probably not really tested yet.
		Changes to how floating point values are handled in
		src/coproc.c, but right now it is probably very unstable.
20041101	I had accidentally removed the instructions on how to install
		Ultrix from doc/index.html. They are back now.
		Adding a -Z option, which makes it easier to run dual- or
		tripple-head with Ultrix. (Default nr of graphics cards
		without -X is 0, with -X is 1.)
		Minor update which makes it possible to switch to the left
		monitor when running tripple-head, not just right as before.
		When using more than one framebuffer window, and the host's
		mouse cursor is in a different window than the emulated mouse
		cursor, the emulated mouse will now try to move "very far",
		so that it in practice changes screen.
		Running Ultrix with dual- and tripple-head now feels really
		great.
20041101(later)	OpenBSD/arc and Linux/Olivetti-M700 don't both work at the
		same time with the speed-hack stuff. So, from now on, you
		need to add -J for Linux, and add nothing for openbsd.
20041102	Minor update for OSF/1 V4.0 (include sys/time.h in src/net.c
		and add -D_POSIX_PII_SOCKET to the C compiler flags).
20041103	Minor updates for the release.
		For some reason, Mach/PMAX caused the emulator to bug out on
		SunOS/sparc64 (compiled in 64-bit mode); a minor update/hack
		to dev_asc fixed this.

==============  RELEASE 0.2.2  ==============

20041103	Minor updates.
20041104	Minor updates.
20041105	Running with different framebuffer windows on different X11
		displays works now (even with different bit depths and
		endiannesses on different displays). A new command line option
		(-z) adds DISPLAYs that should be used.
		Update regarding how DECstation BT459 cursors are used;
		transparency :-) and some other bug fixes.
20041106	More bt459 updates. The cursor color seems to be correct for
		NetBSD, OpenBSD, Ultrix, and Sprite.
		Some minor bintrans updates (redesigning some things).
20041107	More bintrans updates (probably broken for non-Alpha targets).
		Moving doc/mips64emul.1 to man/.
20041108	Some updates.
20041109	More updates. Bintrans experiments mostly.
20041110	Some minor bintrans updates.
20041111	Minor updates.
20041112	A little rewrite of the bintrans system (again :-), this time
		a lot more naïve and non-optimizing, in order to support delay
		slots in a much simpler way.
		Ultrix 4.5 boots into a usable desktop on my home machine in
		3min 28sec, compared to 6-8 minutes without bintrans.
20041113	Some minor bintrans updates.
20041114	More bintrans updates. Ultrix now boots in exactly 3 minutes
		on my home machine.
20041115	More bintrans updates.
20041116	Bintrans updates.
20041117	Working on dev_dec_ioasic and related issues.
		Adding support for letting translated code access devices in
		some cases (such as framebuffers).
20041118	Moving some MIPS registers into Alpha registers, which gives
		a speed improvement.
		Beginning to write an i386 bintrans backend. Skeleton stuff
		works, lui, jr/jalr, addiu/daddiu/andi/ori/xori, j/jal,
		addu/daddu/subu/xor/or/nor/and.
20041119	dsubu/sll/srl/sra, rfe,mfc0,dmfc0, beq,bne, delayed branches.
		Some load/store (but not for bigendian emulation yet.)
		Time to reach Ultrix 4.5's graphical login on a 2.8 GHz Xeon
		host is now down to 20 seconds!
		Adding bgez, bltz, bgtz, and blez to the i386 backend.
20041120	Minor updates (bintrans related mostly).
		Time to reach Ultrix login on the Xeon is now 11 seconds.
		Adding 'mult', 'multu' and a some parts of mtc0 to the Alpha
		backend.
		The transparency updates to the X11 cursor support made the
		OpenBSD/arc cursor disappear; that has been fixed now.
		Unfortunately, something with Acer Pica emulation is broken
		when bintrans is enabled.
20041121	Making tlbwr, tlbwi, tlbp, tlbr callable directly from
		translated code.
		Adding sltiu, slti, slt, and sltu to the i386 backend.
20041122	More bintrans updates.
		With the Alpha backend, the status and entryhi registers
		can (in some cases) be written without exiting to the main
		loop. Ultrix boot time until a usable desktop is reached
		is about 1 min 35 seconds on the 533 MHz pca56.
		Adding srlv, srav, and sllv to the i386 backend.
20041123	Removing the special handling of high physical addresses for
		DECstation emulation from the main memory handling code, and
		replacing it with a mirror device instead. (This results in
		a tiny increase in performance, and cleaner code.)
		Various minor updates.
20041124	Ripping out _all_ bintrans load/store code, because I have
		a new idea I'd like to try out.
		A total rewrite of the load/store system. It works when
		emulating 32-bit MIPS, but not for 64-bit code yet.
		Some minor updates to the dev_fb, but no speed improvement.
		Making the 'le' ethernet device' SRAM work with bintrans.
20041125	Various updates.
		Adding a little "bootup logo" to the framebuffer.
		There is now one translate_address() for R3000-style MMUs,
		and one for the other types. (This gives a tiny speed
		improvement.)
20041126	Minor updates, bintrans.
		Fixing the bug which caused OpenBSD/arc (R4000) to bug out;
		it was introduced between the 7:th and 10:th of November
		when moving up the check for interrupts to above the code
		which runs bintrans code, in src/cpu.c.
		Adding movn and movz to the Alpha bintrans backend.
20041127	Various minor updates.
20041128	Making the R2000/R3000 caches work with bintrans, even in
		isolated mode. (Not true cache emulation, but it works with
		NetBSD/pmax, OpenBSD/pmax, and Ultrix.)
		Making the default cache size for R3000 4KB instr, 4 KB data;
		a real R3000 could have 64KB each, but emulated OSes run
		faster when they think the cache is smaller :-)
		Updates to the i386 backend: the nr of executed instructions
		is now placed in ebp at all times, and some support for
		mtc0 similar to how it is done in the Alpha backend has been
		added. A full NetBSD/pmax 1.6.2 install can now be done in
		5 minutes 35 seconds, on a 2.8 GHz Xeon host (with -bD2 -M20).
		Adding mult and multu to the i386 bintrans backend.
		Reducing the number of malloc/free calls used by the
		diskimage subsystem.
20041129	Minor updates to the Alpha bintrans backend.
20041130	Trying to fix the bug which prevents Linux from working
		with bintrans. It _seems_ to work now. (Pages could in some
		cases be written to after they were translated, but that
		has been fixed now.)
		A couple of other minor fixes.
		Minor updates to the Alpha backend (directly using Alpha
		registers in some cases, instead of loading into temporaries).
		Updates to the i386 backend (special hacks for 32-bit
		MIPS emulation, which are fast on i386, for example only
		updating half of the pc register).
20041201	More updates to the i386 backend, similar to those yesterday.
		Preparing for release 0.2.3.
		Adding a generic load/store mechanism, which is used when the
		32-bit optimized version cannot be used (for R4000 etc).

==============  RELEASE 0.2.3  ==============

20041202	If ALWAYS_SIGNEXTEND_32 is defined in misc.h, and an
		incorrectly extended register is detected, the emulator now
		exits instead of continues.
		Removing the LAST_USED_TLB_EXPERIMENT stuff.
		Minor updates to work better with Windows NT's ARCINST.EXE;
		printing 0x9b via arcbios becomes ESC + '[', and the ARC
		memory descriptor stuff has been generalized a bit more.
		Adding arbios hacks for Open(), Seek(), GetRelativeTime(),
		and Read() to allow WinNT's SETUPLDR to read the filesystem
		on the diskimage used for booting.
20041203	Adding a terminal emulation layer which converts arcbios
		stdout writes to "VGA text console" cell characters. Seems
		to work with Windows NT and arcdiag.
		Adding a 8x8 font to dev_vga.
		Adding more ARC components to the component tree (for PICA
		emulation).
20041204	Minor updates.
		More updates to dev_vga. Adding a 8x10 font.
		Adding a hack so that the framebuffer logo is visible at
		startup with dev_vga. (It disappears at the first scroll.)
		A minor fix for a bug which was triggered when running
		dual- or tripple-head, on 2 or 3 actual X11 displays.
20041205	Fixing a bintrans bug.
		Some other minor updates (some of them bintrans related).
20041206	Moving the web page to http://gavare.se.
		Adding a hack for mmap() which supports anonymous mapping
		using /dev/zero, but not using MAP_ANON{,YMOUS}.
		Separating out opcodes.h, cop0.h, and cpu_types.h from misc.h.
20041207	Minor bintrans update. (In some cases, it isn't necessary
		to return to the main loop, when translating from a new page.)
		Some other minor i386 bintrans backend optimizations.
		And some other minor updates.
		i386 backend update: the lowest 32 bits of the pc register
		are now placed in an i386 register.
20041208	Adding GetConfigurationData() and some support for config
		data, to src/arcbios.c.
		Adding a bogus 0xbd SCSI command (used by Windows NT). It is
		not listed in http://www.danbbs.dk/~dino/SCSI/SCSI2-D.html.
		If the framebuffer cursor contains more than 1 color, then
		the host's X11 cursor disappears. (Nice for DECstation
		emulation with emulated X.)
		For ARC and SGI emulation, if an exception occurs before an
		exception handler is installed, the emulator now exits
		nicely (as suggested by Alec Voropay).
		A couple of minor updates to the ARCBIOS emulation subsystem.
		The single step debugger is now automatically entered when
		all CPUs have stopped running, unless there was a clean
		shutdown of some kind (PROM halt() call, or similar).
		Adding a -V option for starting up in a paused state, into
		the single-step debugger.
		Adding a note about 'mmon' to the documentation
		(http://www.brouhaha.com/~eric/software/mmon/).
20041209	Fixes to devices/console.c which makes cursor keys and such
		a bit more reliable.
		ARCBIOS hack/update which creates memory descriptors _after_
		loading the executable. (Seems to work with OpenBSD/arc,
		NetBSD/arc, arcdiag, IRIX, NetBSD/sgimips, OpenBSD/sgi, and
		some Windows NT executables.)
		ARCBIOS support for cursor keys (ESC + '[' ==> 0x9b).
		A bintrans update (for 32-bit emulation) which speeds up
		jumps between pages, if code is already translated.
		Changing the default bintrans cache from 20 to 24 MB.
20041210	Optimizing unaligned load/stores a little bit in src/cpu.c.
		Omiting the check for nr of executed bintrans instructions
		on some forward jumps.
		Adding the 'syscall' and 'break' instructions to the
		bintrans backends.
		Allowing more bits of the status register to be written to
		from within inside translated code, on R3000.
		Getting rid of the final pixel when hiding the host's mouse
		cursor.
		store_buf() now copies data 8 or 4 bytes at a time, when
		possible. (This speeds up emulated ROM disk reads, etc.)
		Tiny bug fix: coprocessor unusable exceptions are now also
		generated (for coproc 1..3) even when in kernel mode, if the
		coprocessors are not enabled. This allows a Debian installation
		to proceed further than before. (It's still very unstable,
		though.)
20041212	Updating doc/index.html with better Debian installation
		instructions.
		If SLOWSERIALINTERRUPTS is defined at compile time, interrupts
		from the dc7085 device will not come as often as they normally
		do. This makes Debian seem more stable.
		Decreasing the bintrans cache to 20 MB again.
		Updating some files in preparation for a 0.2.4 release.
20041213	Updating the docs on how to install NetBSD 2.0/pmax, and also
		some updates to the section on installing Debian.
		32-bit bintrans backend optimization: don't inline large
		chunks of code, such as general jumps.
20041214	Minor fix for coproc unusable for R4000 (it's the PC that,
		matters, not the KSU bits).
		Separating out the debugger from emul.c into debugger.c.
		Rewriting parts of the debugger.
		Removing the -U command line option, as it wasn't really
		useful. Also removing the -P option.
		Renaming all instances of dumppoint to breakpoint, as that
		is what it really is.
		When a breakpoint is reached, the single-step debugger is
		entered, instead of just turning on instruction trace.
		Adding a 'breakpoints' debugger command.
		Better fix for coproc unusable on R4000: the KSU bits matter,
		but the ERL and EXL bits override that.
		Fix which allows Debian to boot directly from a disk image
		(with DELO). (It reads multiple separate areas from disk.)
		Update to the SLOWSERIALINTERRUPTS stuff, making it even
		slower.
		Fixes based on feedback from Alec Voropay (-Q with ARC
		emulation skips the setup of arcbios data structures in
		memory, and no sign-extension _after_ writing a 32-bit
		value to a 64-bit coproc 0 register).
		Adding a 'devices' command to the debugger.
		The 'registers' and 'tlbdump' commands now take an optional
		argument (a cpu id).
		Adding rudimentary tab-completion and cursor key stuff to
		debugger_readline().
		Adding some more debugger commands: 'bintrans' and 'machine'.
20041215	Adding a 'devstate' command; implementing a skeleton for a
		state function for the bt459 device.
		Implementing yet another variant of the SLOWSERIALINTERRUPTS
		stuff.
		Implementing more of the different exception offsets (taking
		CAUSE_IV and STATUS_BEV into account).
		hpc_bootinfo should now be correctly filled on big-endian
		hosts.
		Always shift left by 12, not by pageshift, to get physical
		addresses on MMU4K etc. (Thanks to Alec Voropay for noticing
		this.)
20041216	The KN02's CSR can now be read from bintranslated code.
		Adding a dummy dev_sgi_mec.
20041217	The default framebuffer and model settings for -F (hpcmips)
		should now be almost like Cassiopeia E-500.
		Changing -DSLOWSERIALINTERRUPTS into a command line option, -U.
20041218	Continuing a little bit on the mec controller.
		Removing lots of #include <math.h> that weren't really used.
20041219	Fixing stuff that broke because of the pageshift bugfix.
		Adding an argument to the s (step) debugger command, for doing
		more than 1 step at a time.
		ARCBIOS components representing disk images are now created
		to actually match the disk images in use, and some other
		arcbios-related updates; adding a dummy GetComponent().
		Adding a 'lookup' command to the debugger, for symbol lookups.
		Adding a "NEC Express RISCserver" mode (NEC-R96, -A8).
		Adding a dummy ARCBIOS GetFileInformation(), GetTime(), and
		SetEnvironmentVariable().
20041220	Improved command line editing (including command history)
		in the debugger.
		Separating some more .h files from each other, and fixing
		some Solaris compiler warnings.
20041221	Minor updates.
20041222	Minor updates; hpcmips (BE300, VR41xx) stuff.
		The 'register' debugger command is now 'reg', and it can
		be used to modify registers, not just read them.
		The syntax for hpcmips (-F) is now -F xx, where xx is a
		machine model identifier. (1 = BE300.)
20041223	Some really minor updates.
20041226	Minor updates to doc/index.html (NetBSD 1.6.2 -> 2.0, and
		some other rearrangements).
		Many updates to the debugger (better register manipulation,
		breakpoint manipulation, and other updates).
		Fix to dev_cons.c to allow the regression tests to work again.
		The configure script now tries to detect the presence of a
		MIPS cross compiler. (Used by "make regtest".)
		Regression tests are now run both with and without bintrans.
20041227	Some hacks to the VR41xx code to allow Linux for BE300 to
		get far enough to show the penguin on the framebuffer.
20041228	Merging dev_kn01_csr.c and dev_vdac.c into dev_kn01.c.
20041229	Various updates to the debugger (nicer tlb output and other
		things).
		Some floating point fixes in src/coproc.c (mov is not
		an arithmetic instruction), and in src/cpu.c (ldcX/sdcX in
		32-bit mode uses register pairs).
		'-O' now also affects the bootstring for SGI and ARC emulation.
		Bintrans updates (slightly faster 32-bit load/store on alpha).
		Updates to the i386 backend too, but no real speed improvement.
20041230	Cleaning up parts of the 64-bit virtual-to-physical code for
		R10000, and per-machine default TLB entries can now be set
		for SGI and ARC machines.
		Fix: SGI-IP27 is ARC64, not ARCS.
20050101	Minor updates.
20050102	Minor updates.
		Fixing a 32-bit 'addu' bug in the bintrans backends.
		Allowing fast load/stores even in 64-bit bintrans mode, if
		the top 32 bits are either 0x00000000 or 0xffffffff (for Alpha
		only).
		Re-enabling ctc0/cfc0 (but what do they do?).
		Adding beql, bnel, blezl, and bgtzl to the Alpha backend.
20050103	Adding fast 32-bit load/store for 64-bit mode emulation to
		the i386 backend too (similar to the Alpha code). Not really
		tested yet, though.
		Adding an incomplete regression test case for lwl/lwr/ldl/ldr.
		Playing around with bintranslated lwl and lwr for Alpha.
20040104	Changing many occurances of pica to jazz.
		Various other updates.
20050105	Fixing some more bintrans bugs (both Alpha and i386).
		Unaligned stores that cause tlb refill exceptions should now
		cause TLBS exceptions, not TLBL.
		Adding experimental swl and swr to the Alpha backend.
		Adding lwl, lwr, swl, and swr to the i386 backend.
20050106	Adding another hpcmips model (Casio E-105, -F2), and doing
		some updates to the VR41xx code. NetBSD/hpcmips prints some
		boot messages.
20050108	Minor updates.
20050109	dev_dec5500_ioboard.c and dev_sgec.c => dev_kn220.c.
		dev_crime.c, _mace.c, and _macepci.c => dev_sgi_ip32.c.
		Also adding dev_sgi_mec, _ust, and _mte into dev_sgi_ip32.c.
		A slight license change. Still revised BSD-style, though.
		memory_v2p.c is now included separately for MMU10K and
		MMU8K.
		Fixing a NS16550 bug, triggered by NetBSD 2.0, but not 1.6.2.
		Refreshing the UltraSPARC bintrans backend skeleton.
		Merging dev_decbi, _deccca, and _decxmi into dev_dec5800.c.
		Sparc backend instructions done so far: mthi/mtlo/mfhi/mflo,
		lui, addu, daddu, subu, dsubu, and, or, nor, xor, sll, dsll,
		srl, and sra.
		Adding more sparc backend instructions: addiu, daddiu, xori,
		ori, andi, srlv, srav, sllv, slt, sltu, slti, sltiu.
20050110	Changing the default bintrans cache to 16 MB, and some other
		minor updates.
		Adding div and divu to the i386 backend (but not Alpha yet).
		More work on ARCBIOS emulation.
		Trying to find a bug which affects Linux on Playstation 2 in
		bintrans mode.
20050111	Moving around some Playstation 2 stuff, but I haven't found
		the bug yet. It is triggered by load/stores.
		More ARCBIOS updates, enough to let Windows NT partition
		disks in some rudimentary fashion.
20050112	Testing for release 0.2.4.
		Fixes to suppress compiler warnings.

==============  RELEASE 0.2.4  ==============

20050113	Minor updates.
20050114	Fix to the Alpha bintrans backend to allow compilation with
		old versions of gcc (2.95.4).

==============  RELEASE 0.2.4.1  ==============

20050115	Various updates and fixes: some IP32 stuff, the debugger,
		ns16550 loopback tx isn't transmitted out anymore, ...
		Removing old/broken R10000 cache hacks, which weren't really
		used.
20050116	Minor updates to the documentation on using PROM images.
		Adding ARCBIOS function 0x100 (used by IRIX when returning
		from main, but undocumented).
		MC146818 updates (mostly SGI-related).
		ARCS64 updates (testing with an OpenBSD snapshot in IP27
		mode). This causes Linux/IP30 to not work. Maybe IP27 and
		IP30 differ, even though both are 64-bit?
		Removing some nonsensical ARCS64 code from machine.c.
		Better handling of 128MB and 512MB memory offsets used by
		various SGI models.
		Trying to revert the ARCS64 changes (OpenBSD/sgi does
		seem to be aware of 64-bit vs 32-bit data structures in
		_some_ places, but not all), to make Linux/IP30 work again.
		Adding "power off" capability to the RTC, as used on IP32
		(and possibly IP30 and others).
		Some IP30 updates.
20050117	Debugger updates (symbolic register names instead of just rX,
		and using %08x instead of %016llx when emulating 32-bit CPUs
		in more places than before).
		Removing the dummy sgi_nasid and sgi_cpuinfo devices.
		Also using symbolic names for coprocessor 0 registers.
		Adding DEV_MP_MEMORY to dev_mp.c.
		Adding a 'put' command to the debugger.
		ARCBIOS function 0x100 used by IRIX seems to _NOT_ be a
		ReturnFromMain(), but something else undocumented.
		The count and compare registers are now 32-bit in all
		places, as they should be. (This causes, among other things,
		OpenBSD/sgi to not hang randomly in userspace anymore.)
		On breakpoints, the debugger is now entered _at_ the
		instruction at the breakpoint, not after it.
		Some cursor keys now work when inputed via X.
		Refreshing the MC146818 device a bit more.
20050118	Trying to add some support for less-than-4KB virtual pages,
		used by at least VR4131. Thanks to Alexander Yurchenko for
		noticing this. (I'm assuming for now that all R41xx work
		this way, which is not necessarily true.) It doesn't really
		work yet though.
		Renicing the "loading files" messages and other things
		displayed during startup.
		Changing the disassembly output of ori, xori, and andi to
		unsigned hex immediate, instead of decimal (as suggested
		by Alec Voropay).
		configure-script update for HP-UX, and switching from using
		inet_aton() to inet_pton() (as suggested by Nils Weller).
		Also adding -lnsl on Solaris, if required by inet_pton().
		Lots of minor R4100-related updates.
20050119	Correcting the R4100 config register in src/coproc.c, and
		a minor update to dev_vr41xx.
		Finally began a redesign/remodelling/cleanup that I have had
		in mind for quite some time... moving many things that were
		in struct emul into a new struct machine.
		Userland emulation now works with bintrans.
		Refreshing the LANCE controller (dev_le.c).
		Fixing the LK201 keyboard id.
20050120	Continuing on the remodelling/cleanup.
		Fixing the SCSI bug (which was triggered sometimes by
		NetBSD 2.0/pmax on Linux/i386 hosts).
		Adding a speed-limit hack to the mc146818 device when running
		in DECstation mode (limiting to emulated 30 MHz clock, so
		that Ultrix doesn't freak out).
		Adding an ugly workaround for the floating-point bug which
		is triggered when running NetBSD/pmax 2.0 on an Alpha host.
		The count/compare interrupt will not be triggered now, if
		the compare register is left untouched.
		Many, many other fixes...
20050121	Continuing the remodelling/cleanup. (Mostly working on the
		network stack, and on moving towards multiple emulations
		with multiple machines per emulation.)
		Fixbug: not clearing lowest parts of lo0 and hi on tlbr
		(seems to increase performance when emulating Linux?).
20050122	Continuing the remodelling/cleanup.
		Linux on DECstation uses a non-used part of the RTC registers
		for the year value; this is supported now, so Linux thinks
		it is 2005 and not 2000.
		Began hacking on something to reply to Debian's DHCP requests,
		but it's not working yet.
20050123	Continuing the remodelling/cleanup.
20050124	Continuing the remodelling/cleanup.
		Converting the dev_vga charcell memory to support direct
		bintrans access (similar to how dev_fb works), and fixing a
		couple of bintrans bugs in the process.
		The emulator now compiles under OpenBSD/arc 2.3 without
		crashing (mostly due to the bintrans fixes, but also some
		minor updates to the configure script).
20050125	Continuing the remodelling/cleanup.
		The '-a' option was missing in the Hello World example in the
		documentation. (Thanks to Soohyun Cho for noticing this.)
20050126	Continuing the remodelling/cleanup. Moving around stuff in
		the header files, etc. Adding a '-K' command line option, which
		forces the debugger to be entered at the exit of a simulation,
		regardless of failure or success. Beginning to work on the
		config file parser.
		Splitting doc/index.html into experiments.html, guestoses.html,
		intro.html, and misc.html.
		Updating the man page and adding a skeleton section about the
		configure files to doc/misc.html.
20050127	Minor documentation updates.
20050128	Continuing the remodelling/cleanup, mostly working on the
		config file parser (adding a couple of machine words, enough
		to run simple emulations, and adding support for multi-line
		comments using tuborgs).
		Removing some command line options for the least working
		emulation modes (-e, -f, -g, -E, -H), adding new -E and -e
		options for selecting machine type.
		Moving global variables from src/x11.c into struct machine (a
		bit buggy, but it seems to almost work).
20050129	Removing the Playstation 2 mode (-B) and hpcmips modes (-F)
		from the command line as well.
		Changing the -T command line option from meaning "trace on bad
		address" to meaning "enter the single-step debugger on bad
		address".
		More updates to the configuration file parser (nested tuborg
		comments, more options, ...).
		Making -s a global setting, not just affecting one machine.
		Trying to fix the X11 event stuff... but it's so ugly that it
		must be rewritten later.
		Continuing the multi-emul cleanup.
		Bugfixes and other updates to dev_vga.
20050130	Continuing the remodelling/cleanup. Finally moving out the
		MIPS dependant stuff of the cpu struct into its own struct.
		Renaming cpu.c to cpu_mips.c, and cpu_common.c to cpu.c.
		Adding a dummy cpu_ppc.c.
		Removing the UltraSPARC bintrans backend.
		Many other minor updates.
		src/file.c should now be free from MIPS-dependancies.
20050131	Continuing a little bit more on src/file.c. PPC ELFs can now
		be loaded, it seems.
		Continuing on src/cpu_ppc.c.
		'mips' is undefined by the configure script, if it is defined
		by default. (Fixes build on at least OpenBSD/arc and
		NetBSD/arc, where gcc defines 'mips'.)
		A couple of other minor fixes.
		Removing the "Changing framebuffer resolution" section from
		doc/misc.h (because it's buggy and not very useful anway).
		Adding a mystrtoull(), used on systems where there is no
		strtoull() in libc.
		Adding 'add_x11_display' to the configure file parser 
		(corresponding to the -z command line option).
		Continuing the multi-emul machine cleanup.
20050201	Minor updates (man page, RELEASE, README).
		Continuing the cleanup.
		Adding a 'name' field to the emul struct, and adding a command
		to the debugger ("focus") to make it possible to switch focus
		to different machines (in different emuls).
		Beginning to work on the PPC disassembler etc. Hello World
		for linux-ppc64 can be disassembled :-)
20050202	Adding a hack for reading symbols from Microsoft's variant of
		COFF files.
		Adding a dummy cpu_sparc.c and include/cpu_sparc.h.
		Cleaning up more to support multiple cpu families.
		Various other minor updates.
		Fixing another old-gcc-on-Alpha problem.
20050203	Bintrans cache size is now variable, settable by a new
		configuration file option 'bintrans_size'.
		The debugger can now theoretically call disassembler functions
		for cpu families with non-fixed instruction word length.
		Working more on the mec controller. It now works well enough
		to let both NetBSD/sgimips and OpenBSD/sgi connect to the
		outside world using ftp :-)
		Continuing on the cleanup of the networking subsystem.
20050204	Continuing the cleanup.
		Working on a way to use separate xterms for serial ports and
		other console input, when emulating multiple machines (or one
		machine with multiple serial lines active).
20050205	Minor documentation updates.
20050206	Moving console.c from devices/ to src/, and continuing the
		work on using separate windows for each serial console.
		Trying to get OpenBSD/sgi to boot with root-on-nfs on an
		emulated NetBSD/pmax server, but no success in setting up
		the server yet.
20050207	Continuing on the console cleanup.
		Adding a 'start_paused' configuration file option, and a
		'pause' command to the debugger.
20050208	Everything now builds with --withoutmips.
		Continuing on the documentation on how to run OpenBSD/sgi, but
		no actual success yet.
		sizeof => (int)sizeof in the configure script (as suggested by
		Nils Weller).
20050209	Adding a check for -lm to the configure script.
		Continuing on the cleanup: trying to make memory_rw non-MIPS
		dependant.
		Trying to make a better fix for the cdrom-block-size problems
		on FreeBSD. (It now works with a Windows NT 4.0 cdrom in my
		drive.)
		Began a clean-up of the userland subsystem.
20050210	Continuing the userland cleanup.
		IBM's Hello World example for Linux/PPC64 runs fine now.
20050211	Continuing the cleanup. Removing the --userland configure
		option (because support for userland is always included now).
		Working more on getting OpenBSD/sgi to boot with root on
		nfs. (Booting with the ramdisk kernel, and mounting root via
		nfs works, but not yet from the generic kernel.)
		Major update to the manpage.
		Removing the -G command line option (SGI modes).
20050212	Updating the documentation (experimental devices: dev_cons
		and dev_mp, better hello.c, and some other things).
20050213	Some minor fixes: documentation, 80 columns in some source
		files, better configure script options.
		Adding some more PPC instructions.
		Added a NOFPU flag to the MIPS cpu flags, so that executing
		FPU instructions on for example VR4xxx will fail (as suggested
		by Alexander Yurchenko).
20050214	Implementing more PPC instructions.
		Adding dev_pmppc.
20050215	Continuing the work on PPC emulation. Adding a (mostly non-
		working) NetBSD/powerpc userland mode, a (buggy)
		show_trace_tree thing (simliar to the MIPS version).
20050216	Continuing...
20050218	Continuing the clean-up. (Merging the devices and devstate
		debugger commands, more 80-column cleanup, some documentation
		updates, ...).
20050219	Removing the -D, -A, and -a command line options. Updating the
		documentation, in preparation for the next release.
		Adding interrupt stuff to dev_cons.
		Single-stepping now looks/works better with bintrans enabled.
		Beginning the first phase of release testing; various minor
		updates to make everything build cleanly on Solaris.
20050220	Continuing testing for the release...
                
==============  RELEASE 0.3  ==============

20050221	Minor updates. Some more clean-up.
		Beginning on the new device registry stuff.
20050222	Continuing on the device stuff, and doing various other kinds
		of clean-up.
		Adding a dummy BeBox mode.
		Making the pc register common for all cpu families.
		Adding some more PPC instructions and fixing some bugs.
20050223	Continuing on the BeBox stuff, and adding more instructions.
		Adding an ns16550 to the VR4131 emulation (which is probably
		a close enough fake to the VR4131's SIU unit).
20050224	Minor updates. Adding dummy PReP, macppc, and DB64360 modes.
		Continuing on the device registry rewrite.
20050225	Continuing on the device stuff.
20050226	Continuing more on the device rewrite.
		Separating the "testmips" machine into testmips and baremips
		(and similarly with the ppc machine).
		Redesigning the device registry again :-)
		Adding a "device" command to the config file parser.
		Adding "device add" and "device remove" to the debugger.
		Removing pcidevs.h, because it was almost unused.
20050228	Correcting the Sprite disk image url in the documentation.
20050301	Adding an URISC cpu emulation mode (single-opcode machine).
20050303	Adding some files to the experiments directory (rssb_as.c,
		rssb_as.README, urisc_test.s).
		Continuing on the device stuff.
20050304	Minor documentation update. Also, the SPARC, PPC, and URISC
		modes are now enabled by default in the configure script.
		Some minor PPC updates (adding a VGA device to the bebox
		emulation mode).
20050305	Moving the static i386 bintrans runchunk code snippet (and the
		others) to be dynamically generated. (This allows the code to
		compile on i386 with old gcc.)
		Loading PPC64 ELFs now sets R2 to the TOC base.
		Changing the name of the emulator from mips64emul to GXemul.
		Splitting out the configuration file part of the documentation
		into its own file (configfiles.html).
20050306	Some really minor documentation updates.
		Adding a -D command line option (for "fully deterministic"
		behaviour).
20050308	Minor PPC updates. Adding a dummy OpenFirmware emulation layer.
20050309	Adding a hack for systems without inet_pton (such as Cygwin in
		Windows) as suggested by Soohyun Cho. (And updating the
		configure script too.)
		Adding a dummy HPPA cpu family.
		Some more OpenFirmware updates.
		Faster loading of badly aligned ELF regions.
20050311	Minor updates. Adding a dummy "NEC MobilePro 780" hpcmips
		machine mode; disabling direct bintrans access to framebuffers
		that are not 4K page aligned.
20050312	Adding an ugly KIU hack to the VR41xx device (which enables
		NetBSD/hpcmips MobilePro 780 keyboard input).
20050313	Adding a dummy "pcic" device (a pcmcia card controller).
		Adding a dummy Alpha cpu emulation mode.
		Fixing a strcmp length bug (thanks to Alexander Yurchenko for
		noticing the bug).
20050314	Some minor bintrans-related updates in preparation for a new
		bintrans subsystem: command line option -b now means "old
		bintrans", -B means "disable bintrans", and using no option at
		all selects "new bintrans".
		Better generation of MAC addresses when emulating multiple
		machines and/or NICs.
		Minor documentation updates (regarding configuration files).
20050315	Adding dummy standby, suspend, and hibernate MIPS opcodes.
		RTC interrupt hack for VR4121 (hpcmips).
		Enough of the pcic is now emulated to let NetBSD/hpcmips detect
		a PCMCIA harddisk controller card (but there is no support for
		ISA/PCMCIA interrupts yet).
		Adding preliminary instructions on how to install
		NetBSD/hpcmips.
		Continuing the attempt to get harddisks working with interrupts
		(pcic, wdc on hpcmips).
20050318	Minor updates. (Fixing disassembly of MIPS bgtz etc., 
		continuing on the device cleanup, ...)
20050319	Minor updates.
20050320	Minor updates.
20050322	Various minor updates.
20050323	Some more minor updates.
20050328	VR41xx-related updates (keyboard stuff: the space key and
		shifted and ctrled keys are now working in userland (ie
		NetBSD/hpcmips' ramdisk installer).
		Also adding simple cursor key support to the VR41xx kiu.
20050329	Some progress on the wdc.
		Updating the documentation of how to (possibly) install
		NetBSD/hpcmips, once it is working.
		Adding delays before wdc interrupts; this allows NetBSD
		2.0/hpcmips to be successfully installed!
		Mirroring physical addresses 0x8....... to 0x00000000 on
		hpcmips; this makes it possible to run X11 inside
		NetBSD/hpcmips :-)
		Updating the documentation regarding NetBSD/hpcmips.
		Fixing 16-bit vs 15-bit color in dev_fb.
20050330	Print a warning when the user attempts to load a gzipped
		file. (Thanks to Juan RP for making me aware of this "bug".)
20050331	Importing aic7xxx_reg.h from NetBSD.
		Adding a "-x" command line option, which forces xterms for
		each emulated serial port to always be opened.
		Adding a MobilePro 770 mode (same as 780, but different
		framebuffer address which allows bintrans = fast scrolling),
		and a MobilePro 800 (with 800x600 pixels framebuffer :-).
20050401	Minor updates.
20050402	Minor updates. (The standby and suspend instructions are
		bintransed as NOPs, and some minor documentation updates.)
20050403	Adding an Agenda VR3 mode, and playing around with a Linux
		kernel image, but not much success yet.
		Changing BIFB_D16_FFFF -> BIFB_D16_0000 for the hpcmips 
		framebuffers, causing NetBSD to boot with correct colors.
		New syntax for loading raw files: loadaddr:skiplen:
		initialpc:filename. (This is necessary to boot the Linux VR3
		kernels.)
		The Linux VR3 kernel boots in both serial console mode and
		using the framebuffer, but it panics relatively early.
20050404	Continuing on the AHC, and some other minor updates.
20050405	Adding a note in doc/experimental.html about "root1.2.6.cramfs"
		(thanks to Alec Voropay for noticing that it wasn't part
		of root1.2.6.kernel-8.00).
		Also adding a note about another cramfs image.
		-o options are now added to the command line passed to the
		Linux kernel, when emulating the VR3.
		Adding a MobilePro 880 mode, and a dummy IBM WorkPad Z50 mode.
20050406	Connecting the VR3 serial controller to irq 9 (Linux calls this
		irq 17), and some other interrupt-related cleanups.
		Reducing the memory overhead per bintranslated page. (Hopefully
		this makes things faster, or at least not slower...)
20050407	Some more cleanup regarding command line argument passing for
		the hpcmips modes.
		Playing with Linux kernels for MobilePro 770 and 800; they get
		as far as mounting a root filesystem, but then crash.
		Doing some testing for the next release.

==============  RELEASE 0.3.1  ==============

20050408	Some minor updates to the wdc. Linux now doesn't complain
		anymore if a disk is non-present.
20050409	Various minor fixes (a bintrans bug, and some other things).
		The wdc seems to work with Playstation2 emulation, but there
		is a _long_ annoying delay when disks are detected.
		Fixing a really important bintrans bug (when devices and RAM
		are mixed within 4KB pages), which was triggered with
		NetBSD/playstation2 kernels.
20050410	Adding a dummy dev_ps2_ether (just so that NetBSD doesn't
		complain as much during bootup).
		Symbols starting with '$' are now ignored.
		Renaming dev_ps2_ohci.c to dev_ohci.c, etc.
20050411	Moving the bintrans-cache-isolation check from cpu_mips.c to
		cpu_mips_coproc.c. (I thought this would give a speedup, but
		it's not noticable.)
		Better playstation2 sbus interrupt code.
		Skip ahead many ticks if the count register is read manually.
		(This increases the speed of delay-loops that simply read
		the count register.)
20050412	Updates to the playstation2 timer/interrupt code.
		Some other minor updates.
20050413	NetBSD/cobalt runs from a disk image :-) including userland;
		updating the documentation on how to install NetBSD/cobalt
		using NetBSD/pmax (!).
		Some minor bintrans updates (no real speed improvement) and
		other minor updates (playstation2 now uses the -o options).
20050414	Adding a dummy x86 (and AMD64) mode.
20050415	Adding some (32-bit and 16-bit) x86 instructions.
		Adding some initial support for non-SCSI, non-IDE floppy
		images. (The x86 mode can boot from these, more or less.)
		Moving the devices/ and include/ directories to src/devices/
		and src/include/, respectively.
20050416	Continuing on the x86 stuff. (Adding pc_bios.c and some simple
		support for software interrupts in 16-bit mode.)
20050417	Ripping out most of the x86 instruction decoding stuff, trying
		to rewrite it in a cleaner way.
		Disabling some of the least working CPU families in the
		configure script (sparc, x86, alpha, hppa), so that they are
		not enabled by default.
20050418	Trying to fix the bug which caused problems when turning on
		and off bintrans interactively, by flushing the bintrans cache
		whenever bintrans is manually (re)enabled.
20050419	Adding the 'lswi' ppc instruction.
		Minor updates to the x86 instruction decoding.
20050420	Renaming x86 register name indices from R_xx to X86_R_xx (this
		makes building on Tru64 nicer).
20050422	Adding a check for duplicate MIPS TLB entries on tlbwr/tlbwi.
20050427	Adding screenshots to guestoses.html.
		Some minor fixes and testing for the next release.

==============  RELEASE 0.3.2  ==============

20050428	Disabling the "-fmove-all-movables" option in the configure
		script, because it causes the compile to fail on OpenBSD/sgi.
20050502	Minor updates.
20050503	Removing the WRT54G mode (it was bogus anyway), and adding a
		comment about Windows NT for MIPS in doc/experiments.html.
		Minor updates to the x86 instruction decoding.
20050504	Adding some more x86 instructions.
		Adding support for reading files from ISO9660 CDROMs (including
		gzipped files). It's an ugly hack, but it seems to work.
		Various other minor updates (dev_vga.c, pc_bios.c etc).
20050505	Some more x86-related updates.
		Beginning (what I hope will be) a major code cleanup phase.
		"bootris" (an x86 bootsector) runs :-)
20050506	Adding some more x86 instructions.
20050507	tmpnam => mkstemp.
		Working on a hack to allow VGA charcells to be shown even when
		not running with X11.
		Adding more x86 instructions.
20050508	x86 32-bit SIB addressing fix, and more instructions.
20050509	Adding more x86 instructions.
20050510	Minor documentation updates, and other updates (x86 stuff etc.)
20050511	More x86-related updates.
20050513	Various updates, mostly x86-related. (Trying to fix flag 
		calculation, factoring out the ugly shift/rotate code, and
		some other things.)
20050514	Adding support for loading some old i386 a.out executables.
		Finally beginning the cleanup of machine/PROM/bios dependant
		info.
		Some minor documentation updates.
		Trying to clean up ARCBIOS stuff a little.
20050515	Trying to make it possible to actually use more than one disk
		type per machine (floppy, ide, scsi).
		Trying to clean up the kbd vs PROM console stuff. (For PC and
		ARC emulation modes, mostly.)
		Beginning to add an 8259 interrupt controller, and connecting
		it to the x86 emulation.
20050516	The first x86 interrupts seem to work (keyboard stuff).
		Adding a 8253/8254 programmable interval timer skeleton.
		FreeDOS now reaches a command prompt and can be interacted
		with.
20050517	After some bugfixes, MS-DOS also (sometimes) reaches a
		command prompt now.
		Trying to fix the pckbc to work with MS-DOS' keyb.com, but no
		success yet.
20050518	Adding a simple 32-bit x86 MMU skeleton.
20050519	Some more work on the x86 stuff. (Beginning the work on paging,
		and various other fixes).
20050520	More updates. Working on dev_vga (4-bit graphics modes), adding
		40 columns support to the PC bios emulation.
		Trying to add support for resizing windows when switching
		between graphics modes.
20050521	Many more x86-related updates.
20050522	Correcting the initial stack pointer's sign-extension for
		ARCBIOS emulation (thanks to Alec Voropay for noticing the
		error).
		Continuing on the cleanup (ARCBIOS etc).
		dev_vga updates.
20050523	More x86 updates: trying to add some support for protected mode
		interrupts (via gate descriptors) and many other fixes.
		More ARCBIOS cleanup.
		Adding a device flag which indicates that reads cause no
		side-effects. (Useful for the "dump" command in the debugger,
		and other things.)
		Adding support for directly starting up x86 ELFs, skipping the
		bootloader stage. (Most ELFs, however, are not suitable for
		this.)
20050524	Adding simple 32-bit x86 TSS task switching, but no privilege
		level support yet.
		More work on dev_vga. A small "Copper bars" demo works. :-)
		Adding support for Trap Flag (single-step exceptions), at least
		in real mode, and various other x86-related fixes.
20050525	Adding a new disk image prefix (gH;S;) which can be used to
		override the default nr of heads and sectors per track.
20050527	Various bug fixes, more work on the x86 mode (stack change on
		interrupts between different priv.levels), and some minor
		documentation updates.
20050528	Various fixes (x86 stuff).
20050529	More x86 fixes. An OpenBSD/i386 bootfloppy reaches userland
		and can be interacted with (although there are problems with
		key repetition). NetBSD/i386 triggers a serious CISC-related
		problem: instruction fetches across page boundaries, where
		the later part isn't actually part of the instruction.
20050530	Various minor updates. (Documentation updates, etc.)
20050531	Adding some experimental code (experiments/new_test_*) which
		could be useful for dynamic (but not binary) translation in
		the future.
20050602	Adding a dummy ARM skeleton.
		Fixing the pckbc key repetition problem (by adding release
		scancodes for all keypresses).
20050603	Minor updates for the next release.
20050604	Release testing. Minor updates.

==============  RELEASE 0.3.3  ==============

20050604	There'll probably be a 0.3.3.1 release soon, with some very
		very tiny updates.

==============  RELEASE 0.3.3.1  ==============

20050609	Adding simple MIPS IPIs (to dev_mp).
20050611	Adding an ugly hack to track down low-reference bugs
		(define TRACE_NULL_CRASHES, or configure --tracenull).
		Other minor updates.
20050612	Adding a dummy evbmips mode.

==============  RELEASE 0.3.3.2  ==============

20050617	Experimenting some more with netbooting OpenBSD/sgi. Adding
		a hack which allows emulated ethernet networks to be
		distributed across multiple emulator processes.
20050618	Minor updates (documentation, dummy YAMON emulation, etc).
20050620	strcpy/strcat -> strlcpy/strlcat updates.
		Some more progress on evbmips (Malta).
20050621	Adding a section to doc/configfiles.html about ethernet
		emulation across multiple hosts.
		Beginning the work on the ARM translation engine (using the
		dynamic-but-not-binary translation method).
		Fixing a bintrans bug: 0x9fc00000 should always be treated as
		PROM area, just as 0xbfc00000 is.
		Minor progress on Malta emulation (the PCI-ISA bus).
20050622	NetBSD/evbmips can now be installed (using another emulated
		machine) and run (including userland and so on). :-)
		Spliting up the bintrans haddr_entry field into two (one for
		read, one for write). Probably not much of a speed increase,
		though.
		Updating some NetBSD 2.0 -> 2.0.2 in the documentation.
20050623	Minor updates (documentation, the TODO file, etc).
		gzipped kernels are now always automagically gunzipped when
		loaded.
20050624	Adding a dummy Playstation Portable (PSP) mode, just barely
		enough to run Hello World (in weird colors :-).
		Removing the -b command line option; old bintrans is enabled
		by default instead. It makes more sense.
		Trying to finally fix the non-working performance measurement
		thing (instr/second etc).
20050625	Continuing on the essential basics for ARM emulation. Two
		instructions seem to work, a branch and a simple "mov". (The
		mov arguments are not correct yet.) Performance is definitely
		reasonable.
		Various other minor updates.
		Adding the ARM "bl" instruction.
		Adding support for combining multiple ARM instructions into one
		function call. ("mov" + "mov" is the only one implemented so
		far, but it seems to work.)
		Cleaning up some IP32 interrupt things (crime/mace); disabling
		the PS/2 keyboard controller on IP32, so that NetBSD/sgimips
		boots into userland again.
20050626	Finally! NetBSD/sgimips netboots. Adding instructions to
		doc/guestoses.html on how to set up an nfs server etc.
		Various other minor fixes.
		Playstation Portable ".pbp" files can now be used directly.
		(The ELF part of the .pbp is extracted transparently.)
		Converting some sprintf -> snprintf.
		Adding some more instructions to the ARM disassembler.
20050627	More ARM updates. Adding some simple ldr(b), str(b),
		cmps, and conditional branch instructions, enough to run
		a simple Hello World program.
		All ARM instructions are now inlined/generated for all possible
		condition codes.
		Adding add and sub, and more load/store instructions.
		Removing dummy files: cpu_alpha.c, cpu_hppa.c, and cpu_sparc.c.
		Some minor documentation updates; preparing for a 0.3.4
		release. Updating some URLs.

==============  RELEASE 0.3.4  ==============

20050628	Continuing the work on the ARM translation engine. end_of_page
		works. Experimenting with load/store translation caches
		(virtual -> physical -> host).
20050629	More ARM stuff (memory access translation cache, mostly). This
		might break a lot of stuff elsewhere, probably some MIPS-
		related translation things.
20050630	Many load/stores are now automatically generated and included
		into cpu_arm_instr.c; 1024 functions in total (!).
		Fixes based on feedback from Alec Voropay: only print 8 hex
		digits instead of 16 in some cases when emulating 32-bit
		machines; similar 8 vs 16 digit fix for breakpoint addresses;
		4Kc has 16 TLB entries, not 48; the MIPS config select1
		register is now printed with "reg ,0".
		Also changing many other occurances of 16 vs 8 digit output.
		Adding cache associativity fields to mips_cpu_types.h; updating
		some other cache fields; making the output of
		mips_cpu_dumpinfo() look nicer.
		Generalizing the bintrans stuff for device accesses to also
		work with the new translation system. (This might also break
		some MIPS things.)
		Adding multi-load/store instructions to the ARM disassembler
		and the translator, and some optimizations of various kinds.
20050701	Adding a simple dev_disk (it can read/write sectors from
		disk images).
20050712	Adding dev_ether (a simple ethernet send/receive device).
		Debugger command "ninstrs" for toggling show_nr_of_instructions
		during runtime.
		Removing the framebuffer logo.
20050713	Continuing on dev_ether.
		Adding a dummy cpu_alpha (again).
20050714	More work on cpu_alpha.
20050715	More work on cpu_alpha. Many instructions work, enough to run
		a simple framebuffer fill test (similar to the ARM test).
20050716	More Alpha stuff.
20050717	Minor updates (Alpha stuff).
20050718	Minor updates (Alpha stuff).
20050719	Generalizing some Alpha instructions.
20050720	More Alpha-related updates.
20050721	Continuing on cpu_alpha. Importing rpb.h from NetBSD/alpha.
20050722	Alpha-related updates: userland stuff (Hello World using
		write() compiled statically for FreeBSD/Alpha runs fine), and
		more instructions are now implemented.
20050723	Fixing ldq_u and stq_u.
		Adding more instructions (conditional moves, masks, extracts,
		shifts).
20050724	More FreeBSD/Alpha userland stuff, and adding some more
		instructions (inserts).
20050725	Continuing on the Alpha stuff. (Adding dummy ldt/stt.)
		Adding a -A command line option to turn off alignment checks
		in some cases (for translated code).
		Trying to remove the old bintrans code which updated the pc
		and nr_of_executed_instructions for every instruction.
20050726	Making another attempt att removing the pc/nr of instructions
		code. This time it worked, huge performance increase for
		artificial test code, but performance loss for real-world
		code :-( so I'm scrapping that code for now.
		Tiny performance increase on Alpha (by using ret instead of
		jmp, to play nice with the Alpha's branch prediction) for the
		old MIPS bintrans backend.
20050727	Various minor fixes and cleanups.
20050728	Switching from a 2-level virtual to host/physical translation
		system for ARM emulation, to a 1-level translation.
		Trying to switch from 2-level to 1-level for the MIPS bintrans
		system as well (Alpha only, so far), but there is at least one
		problem: caches and/or how they work with device mappings.
20050730	Doing the 2-level to 1-level conversion for the i386 backend.
		The cache/device bug is still there for R2K/3K :(
		Various other minor updates (Malta etc).
		The mc146818 clock now updates the UIP bit in a way which works
		better with Linux for at least sgimips and Malta emulation.
		Beginning the work on refactoring the dyntrans system.
20050731	Continuing the dyntrans refactoring.
		Fixing a small but serious host alignment bug in memory_rw.
		Adding support for big-endian load/stores to the i386 bintrans
		backend.
		Another minor i386 bintrans backend update: stores from the
		zero register are now one (or two) loads shorter.
		The slt and sltu instructions were incorrectly implemented for
		the i386 backend; only using them for 32-bit mode for now.
20050801	Continuing the dyntrans refactoring.
		Cleanup of the ns16550 serial controller (removing unnecessary
		code).
		Bugfix (memory corruption bug) in dev_gt, and a patch/hack from
		Alec Voropay for Linux/Malta.
20050802	More cleanup/refactoring of the dyntrans subsystem: adding
		phys_page pointers to the lookup tables, for quick jumps
		between translated pages.
		Better fix for the ns16550 device (but still no real FIFO
		functionality).
		Converting cpu_ppc to the new dyntrans system. This means that
		I will have to start from scratch with implementing each
		instruction, and figure out how to implement dual 64/32-bit
		modes etc.
		Removing the URISC CPU family, because it was useless.
20050803	When selecting a machine type, the main type can now be omitted
		if the subtype name is unique. (I.e. -E can be omitted.)
		Fixing a dyntrans/device update bug. (Writes to offset 0 of
		a device could sometimes go unnoticed.)
		Adding an experimental "instruction combination" hack for
		ARM for memset-like byte fill loops.
20050804	Minor progress on cpu_alpha and related things.
		Finally fixing the MIPS dmult/dmultu bugs.
		Fixing some minor TODOs.
20050805	Generalizing the 8259 PIC. It now also works with Cobalt
		and evbmips emulation, in addition to the x86 hack.
		Finally converting the ns16550 device to use devinit.
		Continuing the work on the dyntrans system. Thinking about
		how to add breakpoints.
20050806	More dyntrans updates. Breakpoints seem to work now.
20050807	Minor updates: cpu_alpha and related things; removing
		dev_malta (as it isn't used any more).
		Dyntrans: working on general "show trace tree" support.
		The trace tree stuff now works with both the old MIPS code and
		with newer dyntrans modes. :)
		Continuing on Alpha-related stuff (trying to get *BSD to boot
		a bit further, adding more instructions, etc).
20050808	Adding a dummy IA64 cpu family, and continuing the refactoring
		of the dyntrans system.
		Removing the regression test stuff, because it was more or
		less useless.
		Adding loadlinked/storeconditional type instructions to the
		Alpha emulation. (Needed for Linux/alpha. Not very well tested
		yet.)
20050809	The function call trace tree now prints a per-function nr of
		arguments. (Semi-meaningless, since that data isn't read yet
		from the ELFs; some hardcoded symbols such as memcpy() and
		strlen() work fine, though.)
		More dyntrans refactoring; taking out more of the things that
		are common to all cpu families.
20050810	Working on adding support for "dual mode" for PPC dyntrans
		(i.e. both 64-bit and 32-bit modes).
		(Re)adding some simple PPC instructions.
20050811	Adding a dummy M68K cpu family. The dyntrans system isn't ready
		for variable-length ISAs yet, so it's completely bogus so far.
		Re-adding more PPC instructions.
		Adding a hack to src/file.c which allows OpenBSD/mac68k a.out
		kernels to be loaded.
		Beginning to add PPC loads/stores. So far they only work in
		32-bit mode.
20050812	The configure file option "add_remote" now accepts symbolic
		host names, in addition to numeric IPv4 addresses.
		Re-adding more PPC instructions.
20050814	Continuing to port back more PPC instructions.
		Found and fixed the cache/device write-update bug for 32-bit
		MIPS bintrans. :-)
		Triggered a really weird and annoying bug in Compaq's C
		compiler; ccc sometimes outputs code which loads from an
		address _before_ checking whether the pointer was NULL or not.
		(I'm not sure how to handle this problem.)
20050815	Removing all of the old x86 instruction execution code; adding
		a new (dummy) dyntrans module for x86.
		Taking the first steps to extend the dyntrans system to support
		variable-length instructions.
		Slowly preparing for the next release.
20050816	Adding a dummy SPARC cpu module.
		Minor updates (documentation etc) for the release.

==============  RELEASE 0.3.5  ==============

20050816	Some success in decoding the way the SGI O2 PROM draws graphics
		during bootup; lines/rectangles and bitmaps work, enough to
		show the bootlogo etc. :-)
		Adding more PPC instructions, and (dummy) BAT registers.
20050817	Updating the pckbc to support scancode type 3 keyboards
		(required in order to interact with the SGI O2 PROM).
		Adding more PPC instructions.
20050818	Adding more ARM instructions; general register forms.
		Importing armreg.h from NetBSD (ARM cpu ids). Adding a (dummy)
		CATS machine mode (using SA110 as the default CPU).
		Continuing on general dyntrans related stuff.
20050819	Register forms for ARM load/stores. Gaah! The Compaq C Compiler
		bug is triggered for ARM loads as well, not just PPC :-(
		Adding full support for ARM PC-relative load/stores, and load/
		stores where the PC register is the destination register.
		Adding support for ARM a.out binaries.
20050820	Continuing to add more ARM instructions, and correcting some
		bugs. Continuing on CATS emulation.
		More work on the PPC stuff.
20050821	Minor PPC and ARM updates. Adding more machine types.
20050822	All ARM "data processing instructions" are now generated
		automatically.
20050824	Beginning the work on the ARM system control coprocessor.
		Adding support for ARM halfword load/stores, and signed loads.
20050825	Fixing an important bug related to the ARM condition codes.
		OpenBSD/zaurus and NetBSD/netwinder now print some boot
		messages. :)
		Adding a dummy SH (Hitachi SuperH) cpu family.
		Beginning to add some ARM virtual address translation.
		MIPS bugfixes: unaligned PC now cause an ADEL exception (at
		least for non-bintrans execution), and ADEL/ADES (not
		TLBL/TLBS) are used if userland tries to access kernel space.
		(Thanks to Joshua Wise for making me aware of these bugs.)
20050827	More work on the ARM emulation, and various other updates.
20050828	More ARM updates.
		Finally taking the time to work on translation invalidation
		(i.e. invalidating translated code mappings when memory is
		written to). Hopefully this doesn't break anything.
20050829	Moving CPU related files from src/ to a new subdir, src/cpus/.
		Moving PROM emulation stuff from src/ to src/promemul/.
		Better debug instruction trace for ARM loads and stores.
20050830	Various ARM updates (correcting CMP flag calculation, etc).
20050831	PPC instruction updates. (Flag fixes, etc.)
20050901	Various minor PPC and ARM instruction emulation updates.
		Minor OpenFirmware emulation updates.
20050903	Adding support for adding arbitrary ARM coprocessors (with
		the i80321 I/O coprocessor as a first test).
		Various other ARM and PPC updates.
20050904	Adding some SHcompact disassembly routines.
20050907	(Re)adding a dummy HPPA CPU module, and a dummy i960 module.
20050908	Began hacking on some Apple Partition Table support.
20050909	Adding support for loading Mach-O (Darwin PPC) binaries.
20050910	Fixing an ARM bug (Carry flag was incorrectly updated for some
		data processing instructions); OpenBSD/cats and NetBSD/
		netwinder get quite a bit further now.
		Applying a patch to dev_wdc, and a one-liner to dev_pcic, to
		make them work better when emulating new versions of OpenBSD.
		(Thanks to Alexander Yurchenko for the patches.)
		Also doing some other minor updates to dev_wdc. (Some cleanup,
		and finally converting to devinit, etc.)
20050912	IRIX doesn't have u_int64_t by default (noticed by Andreas
		<avr@gnulinux.nl>); configure updated to reflect this.
		Working on ARM register bank switching, CPSR vs SPSR issues,
		and beginning the work on interrupt/exception support.
20050913	Various minor ARM updates (speeding up load/store multiple,
		and fixing a ROR bug in R(); NetBSD/cats now boots as far as
		OpenBSD/cats).
20050917	Adding a dummy Atmel AVR (8-bit) cpu family skeleton.
20050918	Various minor updates.
20050919	Symbols are now loaded from Mach-O executables.
		Continuing the work on adding ARM exception support.
20050920	More work on ARM stuff: OpenBSD/cats and NetBSD/cats reach
		userland! :-)
20050921	Some more progress on ARM interrupt specifics.
20050923	Fixing linesize for VR4121 (patch by Yurchenko). Also fixing
		linesizes/cachesizes for some other VR4xxx.
		Adding a dummy Acer Labs M1543 PCI-ISA bridge (for CATS) and a
		dummy Symphony Labs 83C553 bridge (for Netwinder), usable by 
		dev_footbridge.
20050924	Some PPC progress.
20050925	More PPC progress.
20050926	PPC progress (fixing some bugs etc); Darwin's kernel gets
		slightly further than before.
20050928	Various updates: footbridge/ISA/pciide stuff, and finally
		fixing the VGA text scroll-by-changing-the-base-offset bug.
20050930	Adding a dummy S3 ViRGE pci card for CATS emulation, which
		both NetBSD and OpenBSD detects as VGA.
		Continuing on Footbridge (timers, ISA interrupt stuff).
20051001	Continuing... there are still bugs, probably interrupt-
		related.
20051002	More work on the Footbridge (interrupt stuff).
20051003	Various minor updates. (Trying to find the bug(s).)
20051004	Continuing on the ARM stuff.
20051005	More ARM-related fixes.
20051007	FINALLY! Found and fixed 2 ARM bugs: 1 memory related, and the
		other was because of an error in the ARM manual (load multiple
		with the S-bit set should _NOT_ load usermode registers, as the
		manual says, but it should load saved registers, which may or
		may not happen to be usermode registers).
		NetBSD/cats and OpenBSD/cats seem to install fine now :-)
		except for a minor bug at the end of the OpenBSD/cats install.
		Updating the documentation, preparing for the next release.
20051008	Continuing with release testing and cleanup.

==============  RELEASE 0.3.6  ==============

20051008	The bug was not because of faulty ARM documentation after all,
		but it was related to those parts of the code.
		Fixing the RTC (dev_mc146818) to work with CATS.
20051009	Rewriting the R() function; now there are 8192 automatically
		generated smaller functions doing the same thing, but hopefully
		faster. This also fixes some bugs which were triggered when
		trying to compile GXemul inside itself. :-)
		Adding a dummy dev_lpt.
20051010	Small hack to not update virtual translation tables if memory
		accesses are done with the NO_EXCEPTION flag; a time reduction
		of almost a factor 2 for a full NetBSD/cats install. :-)
20051011        Passing -A as the default boot arg for CATS (works fine with
                OpenBSD/cats).

==============  RELEASE 0.3.6.1  ==============

20051012	Fixing the VGA cursor offset bug, and speeding up framebuffer
		redraws if character cells contain the same thing as during
		the last redraw.
20051013	Adding a slow strd ARM instruction hack.
20051017	Minor updates: Adding a dummy i80321 Verde controller (for
		XScale emulation), fixing the disassembly of the ARM "ldrd"
		instruction, adding "support" for less-than-4KB pages for ARM
		(by not adding them to translation tables).
20051020	Continuing on some HPCarm stuff. A NetBSD/hpcarm kernel prints
		some boot messages on an emulated Jornada 720.
		Making dev_ram work better with dyntrans (speeds up some things
		quite a bit).
20051021	Automatically generating some of the most common ARM load/store
		multiple instructions.
20051022	Better statistics gathering for the ARM load/store multiple.
		Various other dyntrans and device updates.
20051023	Various minor updates.
20051024	Continuing; minor device and dyntrans fine-tuning. Adding the
		first "reasonable" instruction combination hacks for ARM (the
		cores of NetBSD/cats' memset and memcpy).
20051025	Fixing a dyntrans-related bug in dev_vga. Also changing the
		dyntrans low/high access notification to only be updated on
		writes, not reads. Hopefully it will be enough. (dev_vga in
		charcell mode now seems to work correctly with both reads and
		writes.)
		Experimenting with gathering dyntrans statistics (which parts
		of emulated RAM that are actually executed), and adding
		instruction combination hacks for cache cleaning and a part of
		NetBSD's scanc() function.
20051026	Adding a bitmap for ARM emulation which indicates if a page is
		(specifically) user accessible; loads and stores with the t-
		flag set can now use the translation arrays, which results in
		a measurable speedup.
20051027	Dyntrans updates; adding an extra bitmap array for 32-bit
		emulation modes, speeding up the check whether a physical page
		has any code translations or not (O(n) -> O(1)). Doing a
		similar reduction of O(n) to O(1) by avoiding the scan through
		the translation entries on a translation update (32-bit mode
		only).
		Various other minor hacks.
20051029	Quick release, without any testing at all.

==============  RELEASE 0.3.6.2  ==============

20051031	Adding disassembly support for more ARM instructions (clz,
		smul* etc), and adding a hack to support "new tiny" pages
		for StrongARM.
20051101	Minor documentation updates (NetBSD 2.0.2 -> 2.1, and OpenBSD
		3.7 -> 3.8, and lots of testing).
		Changing from 1-sector PIO mode 0 transfers to 128-sector PIO
		mode 3 (in dev_wdc).
		Various minor ARM dyntrans updates (pc-relative loads from
		within the same page as the instruction are now treated as
		constant "mov").
20051102	Re-enabling instruction combinations (they were accidentally
		disabled).
		Dyntrans TLB entries are now overwritten using a round-robin
		scheme instead of randomly. This increases performance.
		Fixing a typo in file.c (thanks to Chuan-Hua Chang for
		noticing it).
		Experimenting with adding ATAPI support to dev_wdc (to make
		emulated *BSD detect cdroms as cdroms, not harddisks).
20051104	Various minor updates.
20051105	Continuing on the ATAPI emulation. Seems to work well enough
		for a NetBSD/cats installation, but not OpenBSD/cats.
		Various other updates.
20051106	Modifying the -Y command line option to allow scaleup with
		certain graphic controllers (only dev_vga so far), not just
		scaledown.
		Some minor dyntrans cleanups.
20051107	Beginning a cleanup up the PCI subsystem (removing the
		read_register hack, etc).
20051108	Continuing the cleanup; splitting up some pci devices into a
		normal autodev device and some separate pci glue code.
20051109	Continuing on the PCI bus stuff; all old pci_*.c have been
		incorporated into normal devices and/or rewritten as glue code
		only, adding a dummy Intel 82371AB PIIX4 for Malta (not really
		tested yet).
		Minor pckbc fix so that Linux doesn't complain.
		Working on the DEC 21143 NIC (ethernet mac rom stuff mostly).
		Various other minor fixes.
20051110	Some more ARM dyntrans fine-tuning (e.g. some instruction
		combinations (cmps followed by conditional branch within the
		same page) and special cases for DPIs with regform when the
		shifter isn't used).
20051111	ARM dyntrans updates: O(n)->O(1) for just-mark-as-non-
		writable in the generic pc_to_pointers function, and some other
		minor hacks.
		Merging Cobalt and evbmips (Malta) ISA interrupt handling,
		and some minor fixes to allow Linux to accept harddisk irqs.
20051112	Minor device updates (pckbc, dec21143, lpt, ...), most
		importantly fixing the ALI M1543/M5229 so that harddisk irqs
		work with Linux/CATS.
20051113	Some more generalizations of the PCI subsystem.
		Finally took the time to add a hack for SCSI CDROM TOCs; this
		enables OpenBSD to use partition 'a' (as needed by the OpenBSD
		installer), and Windows NT's installer to get a bit further.
		Also fixing dev_wdc to allow Linux to detect ATAPI CDROMs.
		Continuing on the DEC 21143.
20051114	Minor ARM dyntrans tweaks; ARM cmps+branch optimization when
		comparing with 0, and generalizing the xchg instr. comb.
		Adding disassembly of ARM mrrc/mcrr and q{,d}{add,sub}.
20051115	Continuing on various PPC things (BATs, other address trans-
		lation things, various loads/stores, BeBox emulation, etc.).
		Beginning to work on PPC interrupt/exception support.
20051116	Factoring out some code which initializes legacy ISA devices
		from those machines that use them (bus_isa).
		Continuing on PPC interrupt/exception support.
20051117	Minor Malta fixes: RTC year offset = 80, disabling a speed hack
		which caused NetBSD to detect a too fast cpu, and adding a new
		hack to make Linux detect a faster cpu.
		Continuing on the Artesyn PM/PPC emulation mode.
		Adding an Algor emulation skeleton (P4032 and P5064);
		implementing some of the basics.
		Continuing on PPC emulation in general; usage of unimplemented
		SPRs is now easier to track, continuing on memory/exception
		related issues, etc.
20051118	More work on PPC emulation (tgpr0..3, exception handling,
		memory stuff, syscalls, etc.).
20051119	Changing the ARM dyntrans code to mostly use cpu->pc, and not
		necessarily use arm reg 15. Seems to work.
		Various PPC updates; continuing on the PReP emulation mode.
20051120	Adding a workaround/hack to dev_mc146818 to allow NetBSD/prep
		to detect the clock.
20051121	More cleanup of the PCI bus (memory and I/O bases, etc).
		Continuing on various PPC things (decrementer and timebase,
		WDCs on obio (on PReP) use irq 13, not 14/15).
20051122	Continuing on the CPC700 controller (interrupts etc) for PMPPC,
		and on PPC stuff in general.
		Finally! After some bug fixes to the virtual to physical addr
		translation, NetBSD/{prep,pmppc} 2.1 reach userland and are
		stable enough to be interacted with.
		More PCI updates; reverse-endian device access for PowerPC etc.
20051123	Generalizing the IEEE floating point subsystem (moving it out
		from src/cpus/cpu_mips_coproc.c into a new src/float_emul.c).
		Input via slave xterms was sometimes not really working; fixing
		this for ns16550, and a warning message is now displayed if
		multiple non-xterm consoles are active.
		Adding some PPC floating point support, etc.
		Various interrupt related updates (dev_wdc, _ns16550, _8259,
		and the isa32 common code in machine.c).
		NetBSD/prep can now be installed! :-) (Well, with some manual
		commands necessary before running sysinst.) Updating the
		documentation and various other things to reflect this.
20051124	Various minor documentation updates.
		Continuing the work on the DEC 21143 NIC.
20051125	LOTS of work on the 21143. Both OpenBSD and NetBSD work fine
		with it now, except that OpenBSD sometimes gives a time-out
		warning.
		Minor documentation updates.

==============  RELEASE 0.3.7  ==============

20051126	Cobalt and PReP now work with the 21143 NIC.
		Continuing on Alpha dyntrans things.
		Fixing some more left-shift-by-24 to unsigned.
20051127	Working on OpenFirmware emulation; major cleanup/redesign.
		Progress on MacPPC emulation: NetBSD detects two CPUs (when
		running with -n 2), framebuffer output (for text) works.
		Adding quick-hack Bandit PCI controller and "gc" interrupt
		controller for MacPPC.
20051128	Changing from a Bandit to a Uni-North controller for macppc.
		Continuing on OpenFirmware and MacPPC emulation in general
		(obio controller, and wdc attached to the obio seems to work).
20051129	More work on MacPPC emulation (adding a dummy ADB controller).
		Continuing the PCI bus cleanup (endianness and tag composition)
		and rewriting all PCI controllers' access functions.
20051130	Various minor PPC dyntrans optimizations.
		Manually inlining some parts of the framebuffer redraw routine.
		Slowly beginning the conversion of the old MIPS emulation into
		dyntrans (but this will take quite some time to get right).
		Generalizing quick_pc_to_pointers.
20051201	Documentation update (David Muse has made available a kernel
		which simplifies Debian/DECstation installation).
		Continuing on the ADB bus controller.
20051202	Beginning a rewrite of the Zilog serial controller (dev_zs).
20051203	Continuing on the zs rewrite (now called dev_z8530); conversion
		to devinit style.
		Reworking some of the input-only vs output-only vs input-output
		details of src/console.c, better warning messages, and adding
		a debug dump.
		Removing the concept of "device state"; it wasn't really used.
		Changing some debug output (-vv should now be used to show all
		details about devices and busses; not shown during normal
		startup anymore).
		Beginning on some SPARC instruction disassembly support.
20051204	Minor PPC updates (WALNUT skeleton stuff).
		Continuing on the MIPS dyntrans rewrite.
		More progress on the ADB controller (a keyboard is "detected"
		by NetBSD and OpenBSD).
		Downgrading OpenBSD/arc as a guest OS from "working" to
		"almost working" in the documentation.
		Progress on Algor emulation ("v3" PCI controller).
20051205	Minor updates.
20051207	Sorting devices according to address; this reduces complexity
		of device lookups from O(n) to O(log n) in memory_rw (but no
		real performance increase (yet) in experiments).
20051210	Beginning the work on native dyntrans backends (by making a
		simple skeleton; so far only for Alpha hosts).
20051211	Some very minor SPARC updates.
20051215	Fixing a bug in the MIPS mul (note: not mult) instruction,
		so it also works with non-64-bit emulation. (Thanks to Alec
		Voropay for noticing the problem.)
20051216	More work on the fake/empty/simple/skeleton/whatever backend;
		performance doesn't increase, so this isn't really worth it,
		but it was probably worth it to prepare for a real backend
		later.
20051219	More instr call statistics gathering and analysis stuff.
20051220	Another fix for MIPS 'mul'. Also converting mul and {d,}cl{o,z}
		to dyntrans.
		memory_ppc.c syntax error fix (noticed by Peter Valchev).
		Beginning to move out machines from src/machine.c into
		individual files in src/machines (in a way similar to the
		autodev system for devices).
20051222	Updating the documentation regarding NetBSD/pmax 3.0.
20051223	- " - NetBSD/cats 3.0.
20051225	- " - NetBSD/hpcmips 3.0.
20051226	Continuing on the machine registry redesign.
		Adding support for ARM rrx (33-bit rotate).
		Fixing some signed/unsigned issues (exposed by gcc -W).
20051227	Fixing the bug which prevented a NetBSD/prep 3.0 install kernel
		from starting (triggered when an mtmsr was the last instruction
		on a page). Unfortunately not enough to get the kernel to run
		as well as the 2.1 kernels did.
20051230	Some dyntrans refactoring.
20051231	Continuing on the machine registry redesign.
20060101-10	Continuing... moving more machines. Moving MD interrupt stuff
		from machine.c into a new src/machines/interrupts.c.
20060114	Adding various mvmeppc machine skeletons.
20060115	Continuing on mvme* stuff. NetBSD/mvmeppc prints boot messages
		(for MVME1600) and reaches the root device prompt, but no
		specific hardware devices are emulated yet.
20060116	Minor updates to the mvme1600 emulation mode; the Eagle PCI bus
		seems to work without much modification, and a 21143 can be
		detected, interrupts might work (but untested so far).
		Adding a fake MK48Txx (mkclock) device, for NetBSD/mvmeppc.
20060121	Adding an aux control register for ARM. (A BIG thank you to
		Olivier Houchard for tracking down this bug.)
20060122	Adding more ARM instructions (smulXY), and dev_iq80321_7seg.
20060124	Adding disassembly of more ARM instructions (mia*, mra/mar),
		and some semi-bogus XScale and i80321 registers.
20060201-02	Various minor updates. Moving the last machines out of
		machine.c.
20060204	Adding a -c command line option, for running debugger commands
		before the simulation starts, but after all files have been
		loaded.
		Minor iq80321-related updates.
20060209	Minor hacks (DEVINIT macro, etc).
		Preparing for the generalization of the 64-bit dyntrans address
		translation subsystem.
20060216	Adding ARM ldrd (double-register load).
20060217	Continuing on various ARM-related stuff.
20060218	More progress on the ATA/wdc emulation for NetBSD/iq80321.
		NetBSD/evbarm can now be installed :-)  Updating the docs, etc.
		Continuing on Algor emulation.

==============  RELEASE 0.3.8  ==============

20060219	Various minor updates. Removing the old MIPS16 skeleton code,
		because it will need to be rewritten for dyntrans anyway.
20060220-22	Removing the non-working dyntrans backend support.
		Continuing on the 64-bit dyntrans virtual memory generalization.
20060223	More work on the 64-bit vm generalization.
20060225	Beginning on MIPS dyntrans load/store instructions.
		Minor PPC updates (64-bit load/store, etc).
		Fixes for the variable-instruction-length framework, some
		minor AVR updates (a simple Hello World program works!).
		Beginning on a skeleton for automatically generating documen-
		tation (for devices etc.).
20060226	PPC updates (adding some more 64-bit instructions, etc).
		AVR updates (more instructions).
		FINALLY found and fixed the zs bug, making NetBSD/macppc
		accept the serial console.
20060301	Adding more AVR instructions.
20060304	Continuing on AVR-related stuff. Beginning on a framework for
		cycle-accurate device emulation. Adding an experimental "PAL
		TV" device (just a dummy so far).
20060305	Adding more AVR instructions.
		Adding a dummy epcom serial controller (for TS7200 emulation).
20060310	Removing the emul() command from configuration files, so only
		net() and machine() are supported.
		Minor progress on the MIPS dyntrans rewrite.
20060311	Continuing on the MIPS dyntrans rewrite (adding more
		instructions, etc).
20060315	Adding more instructions (sllv, srav, srlv, bgtz[l], blez[l],
		beql, bnel, slti[u], various loads and stores).
20060316	Removing the ALWAYS_SIGNEXTEND_32 option, since it was rarely
		used.
		Adding more MIPS dyntrans instructions, and fixing bugs.
20060318	Implementing fast loads/stores for MIPS dyntrans (big/little
		endian, 32-bit and 64-bit modes).
20060320	Making MIPS dyntrans the default configure option; use
		"--enable-oldmips" to use the old bintrans system.
		Adding MIPS dyntrans dmult[u]; minor updates.
20060322	Continuing... adding some more instructions.
		Adding a simple skeleton for demangling C++ "_ZN" symbols.
20060323	Moving src/debugger.c into a new directory (src/debugger/).
20060324	Fixing the hack used to load PPC ELFs (useful for relocated
		Linux/ppc kernels), and adding a dummy G3 machine mode.
20060325-26	Beginning to experiment with GDB remote serial protocol
		connections; adding a -G command line option for selecting
		which TCP port to listen to.
20060330	Beginning a major cleanup to replace things like "0x%016llx"
		with more correct "0x%016"PRIx64, etc.
		Continuing on the GDB remote serial protocol support.
20060331	More cleanup, and some minor GDB remote progress.
20060402	Adding a hack to the configure script, to allow compilation
		on systems that lack PRIx64 etc.
20060406	Removing the temporary FreeBSD/arm hack in dev_ns16550.c and
		replacing it with a better fix from Olivier Houchard.
20060407	A remote debugger (gdb or ddd) can now start and stop the
		emulator using the GDB remote serial protocol, and registers
		and memory can be read. MIPS only for now.
20060408	More GDB progress: single-stepping also works, and also adding
		support for ARM, PowerPC, and Alpha targets.
		Continuing on the delay-slot-across-page-boundary issue.
20060412	Minor update: beginning to add support for the SPARC target
		to the remote GDB functionality.
20060414	Various MIPS updates: adding more instructions for dyntrans
		(eret, add), and making some exceptions work. Fixing a bug
		in dmult[u].
		Implementing the first SPARC instructions (sethi, or).
20060415	Adding "magic trap" instructions so that PROM calls can be
		software emulated in MIPS dyntrans.
		Adding more MIPS dyntrans instructions (ddiv, dadd) and
		fixing another bug in dmult.
20060416	More MIPS dyntrans progress: adding [d]addi, movn, movz, dsllv,
		rfi, an ugly hack for supporting R2000/R3000 style faked caches,
		preliminary interrupt support, and various other updates and
		bugfixes.
20060417	Adding more SPARC instructions (add, sub, sll[x], sra[x],
		srl[x]), and useful SPARC header definitions.
		Adding the first (trivial) x86/AMD64 dyntrans instructions (nop,
		cli/sti, stc/clc, std/cld, simple mov, inc ax). Various other
		x86 updates related to variable instruction length stuff.
		Adding unaligned loads/stores to the MIPS dyntrans mode (but
		still using the pre-dyntrans (slow) imlementation).
20060419	Fixing a MIPS dyntrans exception-in-delay-slot bug.
		Removing the old "show opcode statistics" functionality, since
		it wasn't really useful and isn't implemented for dyntrans.
		Single-stepping (or running with instruction trace) now looks
		ok with dyntrans with delay-slot architectures.
20060420	Minor hacks (removing the -B command line option when compiled
		for non-bintrans, and some other very minor updates).
		Adding (slow) MIPS dyntrans load-linked/store-conditional.
20060422	Applying fixes for bugs discovered by Nils Weller's nwcc
		(static DEC memmap => now per machine, and adding an extern
		keyword in cpu_arm_instr.c).
		Finally found one of the MIPS dyntrans bugs that I've been
		looking for (copy/paste spelling error BIG vs LITTLE endian in
		cpu_mips_instr_loadstore.c for 16-bit fast stores).
		FINALLY found the major MIPS dyntrans bug: slti vs sltiu
		signed/unsigned code in cpu_mips_instr.c. :-)
		Adding more MIPS dyntrans instructions (lwc1, swc1, bgezal[l],
		ctc1, tlt[u], tge[u], tne, beginning on rdhwr).
		NetBSD/hpcmips can now reach userland when using dyntrans :-)
		Adding some more x86 dyntrans instructions.
		Finally removed the old Alpha-specific virtual memory code,
		and replaced it with the generic 64-bit version.
		Beginning to add disassembly support for SPECIAL3 MIPS opcodes.
20060423	Continuing on the delay-slot-across-page-boundary issue;
		adding an end_of_page2 ic slot (like I had planned before, but
		had removed for some reason).
		Adding a quick-and-dirty fallback to legacy coprocessor 1
		code (i.e. skipping dyntrans implementation for now).
		NetBSD/hpcmips and NetBSD/pmax (when running on an emulated
		R4400) can now be installed and run. :-)  (Many bugs left
		to fix, though.)
		Adding more MIPS dyntrans instructions: madd[u], msub[u].
		Cleaning up the SPECIAL2 vs R5900/TX79/C790 "MMI" opcode
		maps somewhat (disassembly and dyntrans instruction decoding).
20060424	Adding an isa_revision field to mips_cpu_types.h, and making
		sure that SPECIAL3 opcodes cause Reserved Instruction
		exceptions on MIPS32/64 revisions lower than 2.
		Adding the SPARC 'ba', 'call', 'jmpl/retl', 'and', and 'xor'
		instructions.
20060425	Removing the -m command line option ("run at most x 
		instructions") and -T ("single_step_on_bad_addr"), because
		they never worked correctly with dyntrans anyway.
		Freshening up the man page.
20060428	Adding more MIPS dyntrans instructions: bltzal[l], idle.
		Enabling MIPS dyntrans compare interrupts.
20060429	FINALLY found the weird dyntrans bug, causing NetBSD etc. to
		behave strangely: some floating point code (conditional
		coprocessor branches) could not be reused from the old
		non-dyntrans code. The "quick-and-dirty fallback" only appeared
		to work. Fixing by implementing bc1* for MIPS dyntrans.
		More MIPS instructions: [d]sub, sdc1, ldc1, dmtc1, dmfc1, cfc0.
		Freshening up MIPS floating point disassembly appearance.
20060430	Continuing on C790/R5900/TX79 disassembly; implementing 128-bit
		"por" and "pextlw".
20060504	Disabling -u (userland emulation) unless compiled as unstable
		development version.
		Beginning on freshening up the testmachine include files,
		to make it easier to reuse those files (placing them in
		src/include/testmachine/), and beginning on a set of "demos"
		or "tutorials" for the testmachine functionality.
		Minor updates to the MIPS GDB remote protocol stub.
		Refreshing doc/experiments.html and gdb_remote.html.
		Enabling Alpha emulation in the stable release configuration,
		even though no guest OSes for Alpha can run yet.
20060505	Adding a generic 'settings' object, which will contain
		references to settable variables (which will later be possible
		to access using the debugger).
20060506	Updating dev_disk and corresponding demo/documentation (and
		switching from SCSI to IDE disk types, so it actually works
		with current test machines :-).
20060510	Adding a -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE hack for 64-bit Linux hosts,
		so that fseeko() doesn't give a warning.
		Updating the section about how dyntrans works (the "runnable
		IR") in doc/intro.html.
		Instruction updates (some x64=1 checks, some more R5900
		dyntrans stuff: better mul/mult separation from MIPS32/64,
		adding ei and di).
		Updating MIPS cpuregs.h to a newer one (from NetBSD).
		Adding more MIPS dyntrans instructions: deret, ehb.
20060514	Adding disassembly and beginning implementation of SPARC wr
		and wrpr instructions.
20060515	Adding a SUN SPARC machine mode, with dummy SS20 and Ultra1
		machines. Adding the 32-bit "rd psr" instruction.
20060517	Disassembly support for the general SPARC rd instruction.
		Partial implementation of the cmp (subcc) instruction.
		Some other minor updates (making sure that R5900 processors
		start up with the EIE bit enabled, otherwise Linux/playstation2
		receives no interrupts).
20060519	Minor MIPS updates/cleanups.
20060521	Moving the MeshCube machine into evbmips; this seems to work
		reasonably well with a snapshot of a NetBSD MeshCube kernel.
		Cleanup/fix of MIPS config0 register initialization.
20060529	Minor MIPS fixes, including a sign-extension fix to the
		unaligned load/store code, which makes NetBSD/pmax on R3000
		work better with dyntrans. (Ultrix and Linux/DECstation still
		don't work, though.)
20060530	Minor updates to the Alpha machine mode: adding an AlphaBook
		mode, an LCA bus (forwarding accesses to an ISA bus), etc.
20060531	Applying a bugfix for the MIPS dyntrans sc[d] instruction from
		Ondrej Palkovsky. (Many thanks.)
20060601	Minifix to allow ARM immediate msr instruction to not give
		an error for some valid values.
		More Alpha updates.
20060602	Some minor Alpha updates.
20060603	Adding the Alpha cmpbge instruction. NetBSD/alpha prints its
		first boot messages :-) on an emulated Alphabook 1.
20060612	Minor updates; adding a dev_ether.h include file for the
		testmachine ether device. Continuing the hunt for the dyntrans
		bug which makes Linux and Ultrix on DECstation behave
		strangely... FINALLY found it! It seems to be related to
		invalidation of the translation cache, on tlbw{r,i}. There
		also seems to be some remaining interrupt-related problems.
20060614	Correcting the implementation of ldc1/sdc1 for MIPS dyntrans
		(so that it uses 16 32-bit registers if the FR bit in the
		status register is not set).
20060616	REMOVING BINTRANS COMPLETELY!
		Removing the old MIPS interpretation mode.
		Removing the MFHILO_DELAY and instruction delay stuff, because
		they wouldn't work with dyntrans anyway.
20060617	Some documentation updates (adding "NetBSD-archive" to some
		URLs, and new Debian/DECstation installation screenshots).
		Removing the "tracenull" and "enable-caches" configure options.
		Improving MIPS dyntrans performance somewhat (only invalidate
		translations if necessary, on writes to the entryhi register,
		instead of doing it for all cop0 writes).
20060618	More cleanup after the removal of the old MIPS emulation.
		Trying to fix the MIPS dyntrans performance bugs/bottlenecks;
		only semi-successful so far (for R3000).
20060620	Minor update to allow clean compilation again on Tru64/Alpha.
20060622	MIPS cleanup and fixes (removing the pc_last stuff, which
		doesn't make sense with dyntrans anyway, and fixing a cross-
		page-delay-slot-with-exception case in end_of_page).
		Removing the old max_random_cycles_per_chunk stuff, and the
		concept of cycles vs instructions for MIPS emulation.
		FINALLY found and fixed the bug which caused NetBSD/pmax
		clocks to behave strangely (it was a load to the zero register,
		which was treated as a NOP; now it is treated as a load to a
		dummy scratch register).
20060623	Increasing the dyntrans chunk size back to
		N_SAFE_DYNTRANS_LIMIT, instead of N_SAFE_DYNTRANS_LIMIT/2.
		Preparing for a quick release, even though there are known
		bugs, and performance for non-R3000 MIPS emulation is very
		poor. :-/
		Reverting to half the dyntrans chunk size again, because
		NetBSD/cats seemed less stable with full size chunks. :(
		NetBSD/sgimips 3.0 can now run :-)  (With release 0.3.8, only
		NetBSD/sgimips 2.1 worked, not 3.0.)

==============  RELEASE 0.4.0  ==============

20060624	Replacing the error-prone machine type initialization stuff
		with something more reasonable.
		Finally removing the old "cpu_run" kludge; moving around stuff
		in machine.c and emul.c to better suit the dyntrans system.
		Various minor dyntrans cleanups (renaming translate_address to
		translate_v2p, and experimenting with template physpages).
20060625	Removing the speed hack which separated the vph entries into
		two halves (code vs data); things seem a lot more stable now.
		Minor performance hack: R2000/R3000 cache isolation now only
		clears address translations when going into isolation, not
		when going out of it.
		Fixing the MIPS interrupt problems by letting mtc0 immediately
		cause interrupts.

==============  RELEASE 0.4.0.1  ==============

20060626	Continuing on SPARC emulation (beginning on the 'save'
		instruction, register windows, etc).
20060629	Planning statistics gathering (new -s command line option),
		and renaming speed_tricks to allow_instruction_combinations.
20060630	Some minor manual page updates.
		Various cleanups.
		Implementing the -s command line option.
20060701	FINALLY found the bug which prevented Linux and Ultrix from
		running without the ugly hack in the R2000/R3000 cache isol
		code; it was the phystranslation hint array which was buggy.
		Removing the phystranslation hint code completely, for now.
20060702	Minor dyntrans cleanups; invalidation of physpages now only
		invalidate those parts of a page that have actually been
		translated. (32 parts per page.)
		Some MIPS non-R3000 speed fixes.
		Experimenting with MIPS instruction combination for some
		addiu+bne+sw loops, and sw+sw+sw.
		Adding support (again) for larger-than-4KB pages in MIPS tlbw*.
		Continuing on SPARC emulation: adding load/store instructions.
20060704	Fixing a virtual vs physical page shift bug in the new tlbw*
		implementation. Problem noticed by Jakub Jermar. (Many thanks.)
		Moving rfe and eret to cpu_mips_instr.c, since that is the
		only place that uses them nowadays.
20060705	Removing the BSD license from the "testmachine" include files,
		placing them in the public domain instead; this enables the
		testmachine stuff to be used from projects which are
		incompatible with the BSD license for some reason.
20060707	Adding instruction combinations for the R2000/R3000 L1
		I-cache invalidation code used by NetBSD/pmax 3.0, lui+addiu,
		various branches followed by addiu or nop, and jr ra followed
		by addiu. The time it takes to perform a full NetBSD/pmax R3000
		install on the laptop has dropped from 573 seconds to 539. :-)
20060708	Adding a framebuffer controller device (dev_fbctrl), which so
		far can be used to change the fb resolution during runtime, but
		in the future will also be useful for accelerated block fill/
		copy, and possibly also simplified character output.
		Adding an instruction combination for NetBSD/pmax' strlen.
20060709	Minor fixes: reading raw files in src/file.c wasn't memblock
		aligned, removing buggy multi_sw MIPS instruction combination,
		etc.
20060711	Adding a machine_qemu.c, which contains a "qemu_mips" machine.
		(It mimics QEMU's MIPS machine mode, so that a test kernel
		made for QEMU_MIPS also can run in GXemul... at least to some
		extent.)  Adding a short section about how to run this mode to
		doc/guestoses.html.
20060714	Misc. minor code cleanups.
20060715	Applying a patch which adds getchar() to promemul/yamon.c
		(from Oleksandr Tymoshenko).
		Adding yamon.h from NetBSD, and rewriting yamon.c to use it
		(instead of ugly hardcoded numbers) + some cleanup.
20060716	Found and fixed the bug which broke single-stepping of 64-bit
		programs between 0.4.0 and 0.4.0.1 (caused by too quick
		refactoring and no testing). Hopefully this fix will not
		break too many other things.
20060718	Continuing on the 8253 PIT; it now works with Linux/QEMU_MIPS.
		Re-adding the sw+sw+sw instr comb (the problem was that I had
		ignored endian issues); however, it doesn't seem to give any
		big performance gain.
20060720	Adding a dummy Transputer mode (T414, T800 etc) skeleton (only
		the 'j' and 'ldc' instructions are implemented so far). :-}
20060721	Adding gtreg.h from NetBSD, updating dev_gt.c to use it, plus
		misc. other updates to get Linux 2.6 for evbmips/malta working
		(thanks to Alec Voropay for the details).
		FINALLY found and fixed the bug which made tlbw* for non-R3000
		buggy; it was a reference count problem in the dyntrans core.
20060722	Testing stuff; things seem stable enough for a new release.

==============  RELEASE 0.4.1  ==============

20060723	More Transputer instructions (pfix, nfix, opr, mint, ldl, ldlp,
		eqc, rev, ajw, stl, stlf, sthf, sub, ldnl, ldnlp, ldpi, move,
		wcnt, add, bcnt).
		Adding more SPARC instructions (andcc, addcc, bl, rdpr).
		Progress on the igsfb framebuffer used by NetBSD/netwinder.
		Enabling 8-bit fills in dev_fb.
		NetBSD/netwinder 3.0.1 can now run from a disk image :-)
20060724	Cleanup/performance fix for 64-bit virtual translation table
		updates (by removing the "timestamp" stuff). A full NetBSD/pmax
		3.0.1 install for R4400 has dropped from 667 seconds to 584 :)
		Fixing the igsfb "almost vga" color (it is 24-bit, not 18-bit).
		Adding some MIPS instruction combinations (3*lw, and 3*addu).
		The 8048 keyboard now turns off interrupt enable between the
		KBR_ACK and the KBR_RSTDONE, to work better with Linux 2.6.
		Not causing PPC DEC interrupts if PPC_NO_DEC is set for a
		specific CPU; NetBSD/bebox gets slightly further than before.
		Adding some more SPARC instructions: branches, udiv.
20060725	Refreshing dev_pckbc.c a little.
		Cleanups for the SH emulation mode, and adding the first
		"compact" (16-bit) instructions: various simple movs, nop,
		shll, stc, or, ldc.
20060726	Adding dummy "pcn" (AMD PCnet NIC) PCI glue.
20060727	Various cleanups; removing stuff from cpu.h, such as
		running_translated (not really meaningful anymore), and
		page flags (breaking into the debugger clears all translations
		anyway).
		Minor MIPS instruction combination updates.
20060807	Expanding the 3*sw and 3*lw MIPS instruction combinations to
		work with 2* and 4* too, resulting in a minor performance gain.
		Implementing a usleep hack for the RM52xx/MIPS32/MIPS64 "wait"
		instruction (when emulating 1 cpu).
20060808	Experimenting with some more MIPS instruction combinations.
		Implementing support for showing a (hardcoded 12x22) text
		cursor in igsfb.
20060809	Simplifying the NetBSD/evbmips (Malta) install instructions
		somewhat (by using a NetBSD/pmax ramdisk install kernel).
20060812	Experimenting more with the MIPS 'wait' instruction.
		PCI configuration register writes can now be handled, which
		allow PCI IDE controllers to work with NetBSD/Malta 3.0.1 and
		NetBSD/cobalt 3.0.1. (Previously only NetBSD 2.1 worked.)
20060813	Updating dev_gt.c based on numbers from Alec Voropay, to enable
		Linux 2.6 to use PCI on Malta.
		Continuing on Algor interrupt stuff.
20060814	Adding support for routing ISA interrupts to two different
		interrupts, making it possible to run NetBSD/algor :-)
20060814-15	Testing for the release.

==============  RELEASE 0.4.2  ==============

20060816	Adding a framework for emulated/virtual timers (src/timer.c),
		using only setitimer().
		Rewriting the mc146818 to use the new timer framework.
20060817	Adding a call to gettimeofday() every now and then (once every
		second, at the moment) to resynch the timer if it drifts.
		Beginning to convert the ISA timer interrupt mechanism (8253
		and 8259) to use the new timer framework.
		Removing the -I command line option.
20060819	Adding the -I command line option again, with new semantics.
		Working on Footbridge timer interrupts; NetBSD/NetWinder and
		NetBSD/CATS now run at correct speed, but unfortunately with
		HUGE delays during bootup.
20060821	Some minor m68k updates. Adding the first instruction: nop. :)
		Minor Alpha emulation updates.
20060822	Adding a FreeBSD development specific YAMON environment
		variable ("khz") (as suggested by Bruce M. Simpson).
		Moving YAMON environment variable initialization from
		machine_evbmips.c into promemul/yamon.c, and adding some more
		variables.
		Continuing on the LCA PCI bus controller (for Alpha machines).
20060823	Continuing on the timer stuff: experimenting with MIPS count/
		compare interrupts connected to the timer framework.
20060825	Adding bogus SCSI commands 0x51 (SCSICDROM_READ_DISCINFO) and
		0x52 (SCSICDROM_READ_TRACKINFO) to the SCSI emulation layer,
		to allow NetBSD/pmax 4.0_BETA to be installed from CDROM.
		Minor updates to the LCA PCI controller.
20060827	Implementing a CHIP8 cpu mode, and a corresponding CHIP8
		machine, for fun. Disassembly support for all instructions,
		and most of the common instructions have been implemented: mvi,
		mov_imm, add_imm, jmp, rand, cls, sprite, skeq_imm, jsr,
		skne_imm, bcd, rts, ldr, str, mov, or, and, xor, add, sub,
		font, ssound, sdelay, gdelay, bogus skup/skpr, skeq, skne.
20060828	Beginning to convert the CHIP8 cpu in the CHIP8 machine to a
		(more correct) RCA 180x cpu. (Disassembly for all 1802
		instructions has been implemented, but no execution yet, and
		no 1805 extended instructions.)
20060829	Minor Alpha emulation updates.
20060830	Beginning to experiment a little with PCI IDE for SGI O2.
		Fixing the cursor key mappings for MobilePro 770 emulation.
		Fixing the LK201 warning caused by recent NetBSD/pmax.
		The MIPS R41xx standby, suspend, and hibernate instructions now
		behave like the RM52xx/MIPS32/MIPS64 wait instruction.
		Fixing dev_wdc so it calculates correct (64-bit) offsets before
		giving them to diskimage_access().
20060831	Continuing on Alpha emulation (OSF1 PALcode).
20060901	Minor Alpha updates; beginning on virtual memory pagetables.
		Removed the limit for max nr of devices (in preparation for
		allowing devices' base addresses to be changed during runtime).
		Adding a hack for MIPS [d]mfc0 select 0 (except the count
		register), so that the coproc register is simply copied.
		The MIPS suspend instruction now exits the emulator, instead
		of being treated as a wait instruction (this causes NetBSD/
		hpcmips to get correct 'halt' behavior).
		The VR41xx RTC now returns correct time.
		Connecting the VR41xx timer to the timer framework (fixed at
		128 Hz, for now).
		Continuing on SPARC emulation, adding more instructions:
		restore, ba_xcc, ble. The rectangle drawing demo works :)
		Removing the last traces of the old ENABLE_CACHE_EMULATION
		MIPS stuff (not usable with dyntrans anyway).
20060902	Splitting up src/net.c into several smaller files in its own
		subdirectory (src/net/).
20060903	Cleanup of the files in src/net/, to make them less ugly.
20060904	Continuing on the 'settings' subsystem.
		Minor progress on the SPARC emulation mode.
20060905	Cleanup of various things, and connecting the settings
		infrastructure to various subsystems (emul, machine, cpu, etc).
		Changing the lk201 mouse update routine to not rely on any
		emulated hardware framebuffer cursor coordinates, but instead
		always do (semi-usable) relative movements.
20060906	Continuing on the lk201 mouse stuff. Mouse behaviour with
		multiple framebuffers (which was working in Ultrix) is now
		semi-broken (but it still works, in a way).
		Moving the documentation about networking into its own file
		(networking.html), and refreshing it a bit. Adding an example
		of how to use ethernet frame direct-access (udp_snoop).
20060907	Continuing on the settings infrastructure.
20060908	Minor updates to SH emulation: for 32-bit emulation: delay
		slots and the 'jsr @Rn' instruction. I'm putting 64-bit SH5 on
		ice, for now.
20060909-10	Implementing some more 32-bit SH instructions. Removing the
		64-bit mode completely. Enough has now been implemented to run
		the rectangle drawing demo. :-)
20060912	Adding more SH instructions.
20060916	Continuing on SH emulation (some more instructions: div0u,
		div1, rotcl/rotcr, more mov instructions, dt, braf, sets, sett,
		tst_imm, dmuls.l, subc, ldc_rm_vbr, movt, clrt, clrs, clrmac).
		Continuing on the settings subsystem (beginning on reading/
		writing settings, removing bugs, and connecting more cpus to
		the framework).
20060919	More work on SH emulation; adding an ldc banked instruction,
		and attaching a 640x480 framebuffer to the Dreamcast machine
		mode (NetBSD/dreamcast prints the NetBSD copyright banner :-),
		and then panics).
20060920	Continuing on the settings subsystem.
20060921	Fixing the Footbridge timer stuff so that NetBSD/cats and
		NetBSD/netwinder boot up without the delays.
20060922	Temporarily hardcoding MIPS timer interrupt to 100 Hz. With
		'wait' support disabled, NetBSD/malta and Linux/malta run at
		correct speed.
20060923	Connecting dev_gt to the timer framework, so that NetBSD/cobalt
		runs at correct speed.
		Moving SH4-specific memory mapped registers into its own
		device (dev_sh4.c).
		Running with -N now prints "idling" instead of bogus nr of
		instrs/second (which isn't valid anyway) while idling.
20060924	Algor emulation should now run at correct speed.
		Adding disassembly support for some MIPS64 revision 2
		instructions: ext, dext, dextm, dextu.
20060926	The timer framework now works also when the MIPS wait
		instruction is used.
20060928	Re-implementing checks for coprocessor availability for MIPS
		cop0 instructions. (Thanks to Carl van Schaik for noticing the
		lack of cop0 availability checks.)
20060929	Implementing an instruction combination hack which treats
		NetBSD/pmax' idle loop as a wait-like instruction.
20060930	The ENTRYHI_R_MASK was missing in (at least) memory_mips_v2p.c,
		causing TLB lookups to sometimes succeed when they should have
		failed. (A big thank you to Juli Mallett for noticing the
		problem.)
		Adding disassembly support for more MIPS64 revision 2 opcodes
		(seb, seh, wsbh, jalr.hb, jr.hb, synci, ins, dins, dinsu,
		dinsm, dsbh, dshd, ror, dror, rorv, drorv, dror32). Also
		implementing seb, seh, dsbh, dshd, and wsbh.
		Implementing an instruction combination hack for Linux/pmax'
		idle loop, similar to the NetBSD/pmax case.
20061001	Changing the NetBSD/sgimips install instructions to extract
		files from an iso image, instead of downloading them via ftp.
20061002	More-than-31-bit userland addresses in memory_mips_v2p.c were
		not actually working; applying a fix from Carl van Schaik to
		enable them to work + making some other updates (adding kuseg
		support).
		Fixing hpcmips (vr41xx) timer initialization.
		Experimenting with O(n)->O(1) reduction in the MIPS TLB lookup
		loop. Seems to work both for R3000 and non-R3000.
20061003	Continuing a little on SH emulation (adding more control
		registers; mini-cleanup of memory_sh.c).
20061004	Beginning on a dev_rtc, a clock/timer device for the test
		machines; also adding a demo, and some documentation.
		Fixing a bug in SH "mov.w @(disp,pc),Rn" (the result wasn't
		sign-extended), and adding the addc and ldtlb instructions.
20061005	Contining on SH emulation: virtual to physical address
		translation, and a skeleton exception mechanism.
20061006	Adding more SH instructions (various loads and stores, rte,
		negc, muls.w, various privileged register-move instructions).
20061007	More SH instructions: various move instructions, trapa, div0s,
		float, fdiv, ftrc.
		Continuing on dev_rtc; removing the rtc demo.
20061008	Adding a dummy Dreamcast PROM module. (Homebrew Dreamcast
		programs using KOS libs need this.)
		Adding more SH instructions: "stc vbr,rn", rotl, rotr, fsca,
		fmul, fadd, various floating-point moves, etc. A 256-byte
		demo for Dreamcast runs :-)
20061012	Adding the SH "lds Rm,pr" and bsr instructions.
20061013	More SH instructions: "sts fpscr,rn", tas.b, and some more
		floating point instructions, cmp/str, and more moves.
		Adding a dummy dev_pvr (Dreamcast graphics controller).
20061014	Generalizing the expression evaluator (used in the built-in
		debugger) to support parentheses and +-*/%^&|.
20061015	Removing the experimental tlb index hint code in
		mips_memory_v2p.c, since it didn't really have any effect.
20061017	Minor SH updates; adding the "sts pr,Rn", fcmp/gt, fneg,
		frchg, and some other instructions. Fixing missing sign-
		extension in an 8-bit load instruction.
20061019	Adding a simple dev_dreamcast_rtc.
		Implementing memory-mapped access to the SH ITLB/UTLB arrays.
20061021	Continuing on various SH and Dreamcast things: sh4 timers,
		debug messages for dev_pvr, fixing some virtual address
		translation bugs, adding the bsrf instruction.
		The NetBSD/dreamcast GENERIC_MD kernel now reaches userland :)
		Adding a dummy dev_dreamcast_asic.c (not really useful yet).
		Implementing simple support for Store Queues.
		Beginning on the PVR Tile Accelerator.
20061022	Generalizing the PVR framebuffer to support off-screen drawing,
		multiple bit-depths, etc. (A small speed penalty, but most
		likely worth it.)
		Adding more SH instructions (mulu.w, fcmp/eq, fsub, fmac,
		fschg, and some more); correcting bugs in "fsca" and "float".
20061024	Adding the SH ftrv (matrix * vector) instruction. Marcus
		Comstedt's "tatest" example runs :) (wireframe only).
		Correcting disassembly for SH floating point instructions that
		use the xd* registers.
		Adding the SH fsts instruction.
		In memory_device_dyntrans_access(), only the currently used
		range is now invalidated, and not the entire device range.
20061025	Adding a dummy AVR32 cpu mode skeleton.
20061026	Various Dreamcast updates; beginning on a Maple bus controller.
20061027	Continuing on the Maple bus. A bogus Controller, Keyboard, and
		Mouse can now be detected by NetBSD and KOS homebrew programs.
		Cleaning up the SH4 Timer Management Unit, and beginning on
		SH4 interrupts.
		Implementing the Dreamcast SYSASIC.
20061028	Continuing on the SYSASIC.
		Adding the SH fsqrt instruction.
		memory_sh.c now actually scans the ITLB.
		Fixing a bug in dev_sh4.c, related to associative writes into
		the memory-mapped UTLB array. NetBSD/dreamcast now reaches
		userland stably, and prints the "Terminal type?" message :-]
		Implementing enough of the Dreamcast keyboard to make NetBSD
		accept it for input.
		Enabling SuperH for stable (non-development) builds.
		Adding NetBSD/dreamcast to the documentation, although it
		doesn't support root-on-nfs yet.
20061029	Changing usleep(1) calls in the debugger to usleep(10000)
		(according to Brian Foley, this makes GXemul run better on
		MacOS X).
		Making the Maple "Controller" do something (enough to barely
		interact with dcircus.elf).
20061030-31	Some progress on the PVR. More test programs start running (but
		with strange output).
		Various other SH4-related updates.
20061102	Various Dreamcast and SH4 updates; more KOS demos run now.
20061104	Adding a skeleton dev_mb8696x.c (the Dreamcast's LAN adapter).
20061105	Continuing on the MB8696x; NetBSD/dreamcast detects it as mbe0.
		Testing for the release.

==============  RELEASE 0.4.3  ==============

20061107	Adding a new disk image option (-d o...) which sets the ISO9660
		filesystem base offset; also making some other hacks to allow
		NetBSD/dreamcast and homebrew demos/games to boot directly
		from a filesystem image.
		Moving Dreamcast-specific stuff in the documentation to its
		own page (dreamcast.html).
		Adding a border to the Dreamcast PVR framebuffer.
20061108	Adding a -T command line option (again?), for halting the
		emulator on unimplemented memory accesses.
20061109	Continuing on various SH4 and Dreamcast related things.
		The emulator should now halt on more unimplemented device
		accesses, instead of just printing a warning, forcing me to
		actually implement missing stuff :)
20061111	Continuing on SH4 and Dreamcast stuff.
		Adding a bogus Landisk (SH4) machine mode.
20061112	Implementing some parts of the Dreamcast GDROM device. With
		some ugly hacks, NetBSD can (barely) mount an ISO image.
20061113	NetBSD/dreamcast now starts booting from the Live CD image,
		but crashes randomly quite early on in the boot process.
20061122	Beginning on a skeleton interrupt.h and interrupt.c for the
		new interrupt subsystem.
20061124	Continuing on the new interrupt system; taking the first steps
		to attempt to connect CPUs (SuperH and MIPS) and devices
		(dev_cons and SH4 timer interrupts) to it. Many things will
		probably break from now on.
20061125	Converting dev_ns16550, dev_8253 to the new interrupt system.
		Attempting to begin to convert the ISA bus.
20061130	Incorporating a patch from Brian Foley for the configure
		script, which checks for X11 libs in /usr/X11R6/lib64 (which
		is used on some Linux systems).
20061227	Adding a note in the man page about booting from Dreamcast
		CDROM images (i.e. that no external kernel is needed).
20061229	Continuing on the interrupt system rewrite: beginning to
		convert more devices, adding abort() calls for legacy interrupt
		system calls so that everything now _has_ to be rewritten!
		Almost all machine modes are now completely broken.
20061230	More progress on removing old interrupt code, mostly related
		to the ISA bus + devices, the LCA bus (on AlphaBook1), and
		the Footbridge bus (for CATS). And some minor PCI stuff.
		Connecting the ARM cpu to the new interrupt system.
		The CATS, NetWinder, and QEMU_MIPS machine modes now work with
		the new interrupt system :)
20061231	Connecting PowerPC CPUs to the new interrupt system.
		Making PReP machines (IBM 6050) work again.
		Beginning to convert the GT PCI controller (for e.g. Malta
		and Cobalt emulation). Some things work, but not everything.
		Updating Copyright notices for 2007.
20070101	Converting dev_kn02 from legacy style to devinit; the 3max
		machine mode now works with the new interrupt system :-]
20070105	Beginning to convert the SGI O2 machine to the new interrupt
		system; finally converting O2 (IP32) devices to devinit, etc.
20070106	Continuing on the interrupt system redesign/rewrite; KN01
		(PMAX), KN230, and Dreamcast ASIC interrupts should work again,
		moving out stuff from machine.h and devices.h into the
		corresponding devices, beginning the rewrite of i80321
		interrupts, etc.
20070107	Beginning on the rewrite of Eagle interrupt stuff (PReP, etc).
20070117	Beginning the rewrite of Algor (V3) interrupts (finally
		changing dev_v3 into devinit style).
20070118	Removing the "bus" registry concept from machine.h, because
		it was practically meaningless.
		Continuing on the rewrite of Algor V3 ISA interrupts.
20070121	More work on Algor interrupts; they are now working again,
		well enough to run NetBSD/algor. :-)
20070122	Converting VR41xx (HPCmips) interrupts. NetBSD/hpcmips
		can be installed using the new interrupt system :-)
20070123	Making the testmips mode work with the new interrupt system.
20070127	Beginning to convert DEC5800 devices to devinit, and to the
		new interrupt system.
		Converting Playstation 2 devices to devinit, and converting
		the interrupt system. Also fixing a severe bug: the interrupt
		mask register on Playstation 2 is bitwise _toggled_ on writes.
20070128	Removing the dummy NetGear machine mode and the 8250 device
		(which was only used by the NetGear machine).
		Beginning to convert the MacPPC GC (Grand Central) interrupt
		controller to the new interrupt system.
		Converting Jazz interrupts (PICA61 etc.) to the new interrupt
		system. NetBSD/arc can be installed again :-)
		Fixing the JAZZ timer (hardcoding it at 100 Hz, works with
		NetBSD and it is better than a completely dummy timer as it
		was before).
		Converting dev_mp to the new interrupt system, although I
		haven't had time to actually test it yet.
		Completely removing src/machines/interrupts.c, cpu_interrupt
		and cpu_interrupt_ack in src/cpu.c, and
		src/include/machine_interrupts.h! Adding fatal error messages
		+ abort() in the few places that are left to fix.
		Converting dev_z8530 to the new interrupt system.
		FINALLY removing the md_int struct completely from the
		machine struct.
		SH4 fixes (adding a PADDR invalidation in the ITLB replacement
		code in memory_sh.c); the NetBSD/dreamcast LiveCD now runs
		all the way to the login prompt, and can be interacted with :-)
		Converting the CPC700 controller (PCI and interrupt controller
		for PM/PPC) to the new interrupt system.
20070129	Fixing MACE ISA interrupts (SGI IP32 emulation). Both NetBSD/
		sgimips' and OpenBSD/sgi's ramdisk kernels can now be
		interacted with again.
20070130	Moving out the MIPS multi_lw and _sw instruction combinations
		so that they are auto-generated at compile time instead.
20070131	Adding detection of amd64/x86_64 hosts in the configure script,
		for doing initial experiments (again :-) with native code
		generation.
		Adding a -k command line option to set the size of the dyntrans
		cache, and a -B command line option to disable native code
		generation, even if GXemul was compiled with support for
		native code generation for the specific host CPU architecture.
20070201	Experimenting with a skeleton for native code generation.
		Changing the default behaviour, so that native code generation
		is now disabled by default, and has to be enabled by using
		-b on the command line.
20070202	Continuing the native code generation experiments.
		Making PCI interrupts work for Footbridge again.
20070203	More native code generation experiments.
		Removing most of the native code generation experimental code,
		it does not make sense to include any quick hacks like this.
		Minor cleanup/removal of some more legacy MIPS interrupt code.
20070204	Making i80321 interrupts work again (for NetBSD/evbarm etc.),
		and fixing the timer at 100 Hz.
20070206	Experimenting with removing the wdc interrupt slowness hack.
20070207	Lowering the number of dyntrans TLB entries for MIPS from
		192 to 128, resulting in a minor speed improvement.
		Minor optimization to the code invalidation routine in
		cpu_dyntrans.c.
20070208	Increasing (experimentally) the nr of dyntrans instructions per
		loop from 60 to 120.
20070210	Commenting out (experimentally) the dyntrans_device_danger
		detection in memory_rw.c.
		Changing the testmips and baremips machines to use a revision 2
		MIPS64 CPU by default, instead of revision 1.
		Removing the dummy i960, IA64, x86, AVR32, and HP PA-RISC
		files, the PC bios emulation, and the Olivetti M700 (ARC) and
		db64360 emulation modes.
20070211	Adding an "mp" demo to the demos directory, which tests the
		SMP functionality of the testmips machine.
		Fixing PReP interrupts some more. NetBSD/prep now boots again.
20070216	Adding a "nop workaround" for booting Mach/PMAX to the
		documentation; thanks to Artur Bujdoso for the values.
		Converting more of the MacPPC interrupt stuff to the new
		system.
		Beginning to convert BeBox interrupts to the new system.
		PPC603e should NOT have the PPC_NO_DEC flag! Removing it.
		Correcting BeBox clock speed (it was set to 100 in the NetBSD
		bootinfo block, but should be 33000000/4), allowing NetBSD
		to start without using the (incorrect) PPC_NO_DEC hack.
20070217	Implementing (slow) AltiVec vector loads and stores, allowing
		NetBSD/macppc to finally boot using the GENERIC kernel :-)
		Updating the documentation with install instructions for
		NetBSD/macppc.
20070218-19	Regression testing for the release.

==============  RELEASE 0.4.4  ==============

20070224	Minor update to the initialization of the ns16550 in
		machine_walnut.c, to allow that machine type to boot with the
		new interrupt system (although it is still a dummy machine).
		Adding a wdc at 0x14000000 to machine_landisk.c, and fixing
		the SCIF serial interrupts of the SH4 cpu enough to get
		NetBSD/landisk booting from a disk image :-)  Adding a
		preliminary install instruction skeleton to guestoses.html.
20070306	Adding SH-IPL+G PROM emulation, and also passing the "end"
		symbol in r5 on bootup, for Landisk emulation. This is enough
		to get OpenBSD/landisk to install :)  Adding a preliminary
		install instruction skeleton to the documentation. SuperH
		emulation is still shaky, though :-/
20070307	Fixed a strangeness in memory_sh.c (read/write was never
		returned for any page). (Unknown whether this fixes any actual
		problems, though.)
20070308	dev_ram.c fix: invalidate code translations on writes to
		RAM, emulated as separate devices. Linux/dreamcast gets
		further in the boot process than before, but still bugs out
		in userland.
		Fixing bugs in the "stc.l gbr,@-rN" and "ldc.l @rN+,gbr" SuperH 
		instructions (they should NOT check the MD bit), allowing the
		Linux/dreamcast Live CD to reach userland correctly :-)
20070310	Changing the cpu name "Alpha" in src/useremul.c to "21364" to
		unbreak userland syscall emulation of FreeBSD/Alpha binaries.
20070314	Applying a patch from Michael Yaroslavtsev which fixes the
		previous Linux lib64 patch to the configure script.
20070315	Adding a (dummy) sun4v machine type, and SPARC T1 cpu type.
20070316	Creating a new directory, src/disk, and moving diskimage.c
		to it. Separating out bootblock loading stuff from emul.c into
		new files in src/disk.
		Adding some more SPARC registers.
20070318	Preparing/testing for a minirelease, 0.4.4.1.

==============  RELEASE 0.4.4.1  ==============

20070324	Adding a "--debug" option to the configure script, to disable
		optimizations in unstable development builds.
		Moving out SCSI-specific stuff from diskimage.c into a new
		diskimage_scsicmd.c.
		Applying Håvard Eidnes' patch for SCSICDROM_READ_DISKINFO and
		SCSICDROM_READ_TRACKINFO. (Not really tested yet.)
		Implementing disk image "overlays" (to allow simple roll-back
		to previous disk state). Adding a 'V' disk flag for this, and
		updating the man page and misc.html.
20070325	Stability fix to cpu_dyntrans.c, when multiple physical pages
		share the same initial table entry. (The ppp == NULL check
		should be physpage_ofs == 0.) Bug found by analysing GXemul
		against a version patched for Godson.
		Fixing a second occurance of the same problem (also in
		cpu_dyntrans.c).
		Fixing a MAJOR physical page leak in cpu_dyntrans.c; pages
		weren't _added_ to the set of translated pages, they _replaced_
		all previous pages. It's amazing that this bug has been able
		to live for this long. (Triggered when emulating >128MB RAM.)
20070326	Removing the GDB debugging stub support; it was too hackish
		and ugly.
20070328	Moving around some native code generation skeleton code.
20070329	The -lm check in the configure script now also checks for sin()
		in addition to sqrt(). (Thanks to Nigel Horne for noticing that
		sqrt was not enough on Fedora Core 6.) (Not verified yet.)
20070330	Fixing an indexing bug in dev_sh4.c, found by using gcc version
		4.3.0 20070323.
20070331	Some more experimentation with native code generation.
20070404	Attempting to fix some more SH4 SCIF interrupt bugs; rewriting
		the SH interrupt assertion/deassertion code somewhat.
20070410	Splitting src/file.c into separate files in src/file/.
		Cleanup: Removing the dummy TS7200, Walnut, PB1000, and
		Meshcube emulation modes, and dev_epcom and dev_au1x00.
		Removing the experimental CHIP8/RCA180x code; it wasn't really
		working much lately, anyway. It was fun while it lasted.
		Also removing the experimental Transputer CPU support.
20070412	Moving the section about how the dynamic translation system
		works from intro.html to a separate translation.html file.
		Minor SH fixes; attempting to get OpenBSD/landisk to run
		without randomly bugging out, but no success yet.
20070413	SH SCI (serial bit interface) should now work together with a
		(new) RS5C313 clock device (for Landisk emulation).
20070414	Moving Redhat/MIPS down from supported to experimental, in
		guestoses.html.
		Preparing for a new release; doing some regression testing etc.

==============  RELEASE 0.4.5  ==============

20070415	Landisk PCLOCK should be 33.33 MHz, not 50 MHz. (This makes
		the clock run at correct speed.)
		FINALLY found and fixed the bug which caused OpenBSD/landisk
		to randomly bug out: an &-sign was missing in the special case
		handling of FPSCR in the 'LDS.L @Rm+,FPSCR' instruction.
		Adding similar special case handling for 'LDC.L @Rm+,SR'
		(calling sh_update_sr() instead of just loading).
		Implementing the 'FCNVSD FPUL,DRn' and 'FCNVDS DRm,FPUL'
		SuperH instructions.
		The 'LDC Rm,SR' instruction now immediately breaks out of the
		dyntrans loop if an interrupt is to be triggered.
20070416	In memory_rw.c, if mapping a page as writable, make sure to
		invalidate code translations even if the data access was a
		read.
		Minor SuperH updates.
20070418	Removing the dummy M68K emulation mode.
		Minor SH update (turning unnecessary sts_mach_rn, sts_macl_rn,
		and sts_pr_rn instruction handlers into mov_rm_rn).
20070419	Beginning to add a skeleton for an M88K mode: Adding a hack to
		allow OpenBSD/m88k a.out binaries to be loaded, and disassembly
		of a few simple 88K instructions.
		Commenting out the 'LDC Rm,SR' fix from a few days ago, because
		it made Linux/dreamcast bug out.
		Adding a hack to dev_sh4.c (an extra translation cache
		invalidation), which allows OpenBSD/landisk to boot ok after
		an install. Upgrading the Landisk machine mode to stable,
		updating documentation, etc.
20070420	Experimenting with adding a PCI controller (pcic) to dev_sh4.
		Adding a dummy Realtek 8139C+ skeleton device (dev_rtl8139c).
		Implementing the first M88K instructions (br, or[.u] imm), and
		adding disassembly of some more instructions.
20070421	Continuing a little on dev_rtl8139c.
20070422	Implementing the 9346 EEPROM "read" command for dev_rtl8139c.
		Finally found and fixed an old bug in the log n symbol search
		(it sometimes missed symbols). Debug trace (-i, -t etc) should
		now show more symbols. :-)
20070423	Continuing a little on M88K disassembly.
20070428	Fixing a memset arg order bug in src/net/net.c (thanks to
		Nigel Horne for noticing the bug).
		Applying parts of a patch from Carl van Schaik to clear out
		bottom bits of MIPS addresses more correctly, when using large
		page sizes, and doing some other minor cleanup/refactoring.
		Fixing a couple of warnings given by gcc with the -W option (a
		few more warnings than just plain -Wall).
		Reducing SuperH dyntrans physical address space from 64-bit to
		32-bit (since SH5/SH64 isn't imlemented yet anyway).
		Adding address-to-symbol annotation to a few more instructions
		in the SuperH instruction trace output.
		Beginning regression testing for the next release.
		Reverting the value of SCIF_DELAYED_TX_VALUE from 1 to 2,
		because OpenBSD/landisk may otherwise hang randomly.
20070429	The ugly hack/workaround to get OpenBSD/landisk booting without
		crashing does NOT work anymore (with the April 21 snapshot
		of OpenBSD/landisk). Strangely enough, removing the hack
		completely causes OpenBSD/landisk to work (!).
		More regression testing (re-testing everything SuperH-related,
		and some other things).
		Cobalt interrupts were actually broken; fixing by commenting
		out the DEC21143s in the Cobalt machine.
20070430	More regression testing.
20070501	Updating the OpenBSD/landisk install instructions to use
		4.1 instead of the current snapshot.
		GAAAH! OpenBSD/landisk 4.1 _needs_ the ugly hack/workaround;
		reintroducing it again. (The 4.1 kernel is actually from
		2007-03-11.)
		Simplifying the NetBSD/evbarm install instructions a bit.
		More regression testing.

==============  RELEASE 0.4.5.1  ==============

20070501	Continuing a little on m88k disassembly (control registers,
		more instructions).
		Adding a dummy mvme88k machine mode.
20070502	Re-adding MIPS load/store alignment exceptions.
20070503	Implementing more of the M88K disassembly code.
20070504	Adding disassembly of some more M88K load/store instructions.
		Implementing some relatively simple M88K instructions (br.n,
		xor[.u] imm, and[.u] imm).
20070505	Implementing M88K three-register and, or, xor, and jmp[.n],
		bsr[.n] including function call trace stuff.
		Applying a patch from Bruce M. Simpson which implements the
		SYSCON_BOARD_CPU_CLOCK_FREQ_ID object of the syscon call in
		the yamon PROM emulation.
20070506	Implementing M88K bb0[.n] and bb1[.n], and skeletons for
		ldcr and stcr (although no control regs are implemented yet).
20070509	Found and fixed the bug which caused Linux for QEMU_MIPS to
		stop working in 0.4.5.1: It was a faulty change to the MIPS
		'sc' and 'scd' instructions I made while going through gcc -W
		warnings on 20070428.
20070510	Updating the Linux/QEMU_MIPS section in guestoses.html to
		use mips-test-0.2.tar.gz instead of 0.1.
		A big thank you to Miod Vallat for sending me M88K manuals.
		Implementing more M88K instructions (addu, subu, div[u], mulu,
		ext[u], clr, set, cmp).
20070511	Fixing bugs in the M88K "and" and "and.u" instructions (found
		by comparing against the manual).
		Implementing more M88K instructions (mask[.u], mak, bcnd (auto-
		generated)) and some more control register details.
		Cleanup: Removing the experimental AVR emulation mode and
		corresponding devices; AVR emulation wasn't really meaningful.
		Implementing autogeneration of most M88K loads/stores. The
		rectangle drawing demo (with -O0) for M88K runs :-)
		Beginning on M88K exception handling.
		More M88K instructions: tb0, tb1, rte, sub, jsr[.n].
		Adding some skeleton MVME PROM ("BUG") emulation.
20070512	Fixing a bug in the M88K cmp instruction.
		Adding the M88K lda (scaled register) instruction.
		Fixing bugs in 64-bit (32-bit pairs) M88K loads/stores.
		Removing the unused tick_hz stuff from the machine struct.
		Implementing the M88K xmem instruction. OpenBSD/mvme88k gets
		far enough to display the Copyright banner :-)
		Implementing subu.co (guess), addu.co, addu.ci, ff0, and ff1.
		Adding a dev_mvme187, for MVME187-specific devices/registers.
		OpenBSD/mvme88k prints more boot messages. :)
20070515	Continuing on MVME187 emulation (adding more devices, beginning
		on the CMMUs, etc).
		Adding the M88K and.c, xor.c, and or.c instructions, and making
		sure that mul, div, etc cause exceptions if executed when SFD1
		is disabled.
20070517	Continuing on M88K and MVME187 emulation in general; moving
		the CMMU registers to the CPU struct, separating dev_pcc2 from
		dev_mvme187, and beginning on memory_m88k.c (BATC and PATC).
		Fixing a bug in 64-bit (32-bit pairs) M88K fast stores.
		Implementing the clock part of dev_mk48txx.
		Implementing the M88K fstcr and xcr instructions.
		Implementing m88k_cpu_tlbdump().
		Beginning on the implementation of a separate address space
		for M88K .usr loads/stores.
20070520	Removing the non-working (skeleton) Sandpoint, SonyNEWS, SHARK
		Dnard, and Zaurus machine modes.
		Experimenting with dyntrans to_be_translated read-ahead. It
		seems to give a very small performance increase for MIPS
		emulation, but a large performance degradation for SuperH. Hm.
20070522	Disabling correct SuperH ITLB emulation; it does not seem to be
		necessary in order to let SH4 guest OSes run, and it slows down
		userspace code.
		Implementing "samepage" branches for SuperH emulation, and some
		other minor speed hacks.
20070525	Continuing on M88K memory-related stuff: exceptions, memory
		transaction register contents, etc.
		Implementing the M88K subu.ci instruction.
		Removing the non-working (skeleton) Iyonix machine mode.
		OpenBSD/mvme88k reaches userland :-), starts executing
		/sbin/init's instructions, and issues a few syscalls, before
		crashing.
20070526	Fixing bugs in dev_mk48txx, so that OpenBSD/mvme88k detects
		the correct time-of-day.
		Implementing a generic IRQ controller for the test machines
		(dev_irqc), similar to a proposed patch from Petr Stepan.
		Experimenting some more with translation read-ahead.
		Adding an "expect" script for automated OpenBSD/landisk
		install regression/performance tests.
20070527	Adding a dummy mmEye (SH3) machine mode skeleton.
		FINALLY found the strange M88K bug I have been hunting: I had
		not emulated the SNIP value for exceptions occurring in
		branch delay slots correctly.
		Implementing correct exceptions for 64-bit M88K loads/stores.
		Address to symbol lookups are now disabled when M88K is
		running in usermode (because usermode addresses don't have
		anything to do with supervisor addresses).
20070531	Removing the mmEye machine mode skeleton.
20070604	Some minor code cleanup.
20070605	Moving src/useremul.c into a subdir (src/useremul/), and
		cleaning up some more legacy constructs.
		Adding -Wstrict-aliasing and -fstrict-aliasing detection to
		the configure script.
20070606	Adding a check for broken GCC on Solaris to the configure
		script. (GCC 3.4.3 on Solaris cannot handle static variables
		which are initialized to 0 or NULL. :-/)
		Removing the old (non-working) ARC emulation modes: NEC RD94,
		R94, R96, and R98, and the last traces of Olivetti M700 and
		Deskstation Tyne.
		Removing the non-working skeleton WDSC device (dev_wdsc).
20070607	Thinking about how to use the host's cc + ld at runtime to
		generate native code. (See experiments/native_cc_ld_test.i
		for an example.)
20070608	Adding a program counter sampling timer, which could be useful
		for native code generation experiments.
		The KN02_CSR_NRMMOD bit in the DECstation 5000/200 (KN02) CSR
		should always be set, to allow a 5000/200 PROM to boot.
20070609	Moving out breakpoint details from the machine struct into
		a helper struct, and removing the limit on max nr of
		breakpoints.
20070610	Moving out tick functions into a helper struct as well (which
		also gets rid of the max limit).
20070612	FINALLY figured out why Debian/DECstation stopped working when
		translation read-ahead was enabled: in src/memory_rw.c, the
		call to invalidate_code_translation was made also if the
		memory access was an instruction load (if the page was mapped
		as writable); it shouldn't be called in that case.
20070613	Implementing some more MIPS32/64 revision 2 instructions: di,
		ei, ext, dext, dextm, dextu, and ins.
20070614	Implementing an instruction combination for the NetBSD/arm
		idle loop (making the host not use any cpu if NetBSD/arm
		inside the emulator is not using any cpu).
		Increasing the nr of ARM VPH entries from 128 to 384.
20070615	Removing the ENABLE_arch stuff from the configure script, so
		that all included architectures are included in both release
		and development builds.
		Moving memory related helper functions from misc.c to memory.c.
		Adding preliminary instructions for netbooting NetBSD/pmppc to
		guestoses.html; it doesn't work yet, there are weird timeouts.
		Beginning a total rewrite of the userland emulation modes
		(removing all emulation modes, beginning from scratch with
		NetBSD/MIPS and FreeBSD/Alpha only).
20070616	After fixing a bug in the DEC21143 NIC (the TDSTAT_OWN bit was
		only cleared for the last segment when transmitting, not all
		segments), NetBSD/pmppc boots with root-on-nfs without the
		timeouts. Updating guestoses.html.
		Removing the skeleton PSP (Playstation Portable) mode.
		Moving X11-related stuff in the machine struct into a helper
		struct.
		Cleanup of out-of-memory checks, to use a new CHECK_ALLOCATION
		macro (which prints a meaningful error message).
		Adding a COMMENT to each machine and device (for automagic
		.index comment generation).
		Doing regression testing for the next release.

==============  RELEASE 0.4.6  ==============

20070616	Implementing the MIPS32/64 revision 2 "ror" instruction.
20070617	Adding a struct for each physpage which keeps track of which
		ranges within that page (base offset, length) that are
		continuously translatable. When running with native code
		generation enabled (-b), a range is added after each read-
		ahead loop.
		Experimenting with using the physical program counter sample
		data (implemented 20070608) together with the "translatable
		range" information, to figure out which physical address ranges
		would be worth translating to native code (if the number of
		samples falling within a range is above a certain threshold).
20070618	Adding automagic building of .index comment files for
		src/file/, src/promemul/, src src/useremul/ as well.
		Adding a "has been translated" bit to the ranges, so that only
		not-yet-translated ranges will be sampled.
20070619	Moving src/cpu.c and src/memory_rw.c into src/cpus/,
		src/device.c into src/devices/, and src/machine.c into
		src/machines/.
		Creating a skeleton cc/ld native backend module; beginning on
		the function which will detect cc command line, etc.
20070620	Continuing on the native code generation infrastructure.
20070621	Moving src/x11.c and src/console.c into a new src/console/
		subdir (for everything that is console or framebuffer related).
		Moving src/symbol*.c into a new src/symbol/, which should
		contain anything that is symbol handling related.
20070624	Making the program counter sampling threshold a "settings
		variable" (sampling_threshold), i.e. it can now be changed
		during runtime.
		Switching the RELEASE notes format from plain text to HTML.
		If the TMPDIR environment variable is set, it is used instead
		of "/tmp" for temporary files.
		Continuing on the cc/ld backend: simple .c code is generated,
		the compiler and linker are called, etc.
		Adding detection of host architecture to the configure script
		(again), and adding icache invalidation support (only
		implemented for Alpha hosts so far).
20070625	Simplifying the program counter sampling mechanism.
20070626	Removing the cc/ld native code generation stuff, program
		counter sampling, etc; it would not have worked well in the
		general case.
20070627	Removing everything related to native code generation.
20070629	Removing the (practically unusable) support for multiple
		emulations. (The single emulation allowed now still supports
		multiple simultaneous machines, as before.)
		Beginning on PCCTWO and M88K interrupts.
20070723	Adding a dummy skeleton for emulation of M32R processors.
20070901	Fixing a warning found by "gcc version 4.3.0 20070817
		(experimental)" on amd64.
20070905	Removing some more traces of the old "multiple emulations"
		code.
		Also looking in /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib for
		X11 libs, when running configure.
20070909	Minor updates to the guest OS install instructions, in
		preparation for the NetBSD 4.0 release.
20070918	More testing of NetBSD 4.0 RC1.
20070920	Adding a section about HelenOS (for testarm and testmips) to
		the guestoses.html page.
20071014	src/console/console.c now includes <sys/select.h> (thanks to
		Juli Mallett for noticing that this was required on Cygwin).
20071017	Updating Sprite URL in guestoses.html.
20071102	Updating the OpenBSD/landisk install instructions in
		guestoses.html from OpenBSD 4.1 to 4.2.
20071112	Branching in CVS to a 0.4.6.1 version, separate from the main
		development.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		(This is the C++ development branch.)
		EXPERIMENTALLY beginning to convert various source code
		files to C++ (.c to .cc); it will of course be a major
		undertaking to redesign the code so that it fits C++, but I
		think it will be worth it. (main.c => main.cc only so far.)
		Note: Release 0.4.6.1 will most likely be made from the code
		base as it was yesterday, plus perhaps some documentation
		updates.
		Adding configure options "--with-gui" and "--without-gui";
		autodetection of gtkmm-2.4 >= 2.12.1. A binary "gxemul-gui"
		is hardlinked to "gxemul"; when started, it should (in the
		future) bring up a GUI version of GXemul. For now, it just
		displays a dummy GTK+ window.
20071113	The dummy GUI now includes a menu bar.
20071114	Minor manpage and Makefile updates.
		Building and running GXemul now requires both X11 and gtkmm.
		debug/fatal are moved from main.cc to misc.cc.
		main.cc now just calls the main emulator, which is moved to
		src/GXemul.cc.
20071116	Reverting the stuff I did two days ago: gtkmm/X11 are now
		optional again.
		Finally adding "install" and "uninstall" Makefile targets. :)
		Moving the rest of main.cc (the main function) into GXemul.cc.
		Removing the old config file parser (src/emul_parse.c),
		and doc/configfiles.html.
		Moving remaining src/*.c{,c} into a new src/main/ directory.
		Beginning on separating the main GUI window into a "workspace"
		and a "debug console" area.
20071117	Removing the dummy M32R skeleton again.
		Converting some .c files to .cc (without redesigning the code,
		just to make it use the C++ compiler): cpu_sparc.c,
		cpu_mips_coproc.c, memory_*.c.
		Converting most of src/cpus/.
		Converting src/net/*.c and src/promemul/*.c to *.cc.
20071119	Converting src/file/*.c to *.cc.
20071120	Removing remaining references to the old config file stuff in
		the documentaion.
20071121	Converting src/useremul/*.c, src/symbol/*.c, and some
		remaining files in src/main/ to *.cc. (Still no redesign,
		simply converting to use the C++ compiler.)
20071123	Beginning to converting src/machines/*.c to *.cc.
20071124	Planning a new configuration file format; beginning on
		ConfigNode.{cc,h}. Adding doc/fileformat.html.
		Adding a "test" makefile target, for unit testing. "make
		install" runs the test target.
		Implementing a simple refcount_ptr class.
20071127	configure now uses -g also for non-development builds.
		Incorporating Wu Yongwei's debug_new, for memory leak
		detection.
20071209	Converting the remaining src/machine/*.c to *.cc.
		Converting src/debugger/*.c to *.cc.
20071212	Including a Doxyfile, for doxygen generation (source code
		comments to HTML).
20071213	Performing a VERY bold move: Removing pretty much everything of
		the old code. All CPUs, devices, documentation, PROM emulation
		modes, disk and file handling, console handling, the old
		debugger, etc.
		Thinking about the new Component framework.
20071214	Updating the TODO (basically removing all 0.4.x stuff).
		Beginning on some Doxygen documentation for simple classes.
20071217	Moving Doxygen documentation to doc/doxygen/html....
		src/main/GXemul.cc is used for the "main page" of the
		generated Doxygen HTML documentation, so that is where all the
		general code concepts should be documented.
		Adding skeleton Action, ActionStack, and UnitTest frameworks.
20071218	Continuing on the ActionStack and the UnitTest framework.
		Adding a small intro.html documentation page.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		(This is the 0.4.x branch.)
20071219	NetBSD 4.0 has been released. Doing regression testing of
		some systems listed on guestoses.html.
		Fixing an alignment bug in dev_vga, when allocating 1 byte.

==============  RELEASE 0.4.6.1  ==============

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		(This is the C++ development branch.)
20071221	Some extremely minor Doxygen comment updates.
20071227	Adding StateVariable and StateVariableValue classes; writing
		unit tests, etc.
		The ActionStack now uses lists instead of vectors, for the
		undo and redo stack. (For O(1) undo/redo operations.)
		Continuing on the Component infrastructure: parent/child
		relationships, state variables, and serialization.
		Adding a simple Checksum class; useful as a helper for unit
		tests.
20071228	Implementing a CreateComponent function, which when given a
		"component class name" creates a Component.
		Adding a simple EscapedString helper class, for generating and
		decoding C-style escaped strings.
		Simple deserialization works. :)
20071229	Beginning on the CommandInterpreter class.
20071231	Moving src/gui to src/ui/gtkmm, and creating src/ui/console.
		The idea is that all UIs, not only graphical ones, will share
		a common base class (the UI class), making it reasonably easy
		to add other GUIs later on if necessary.
		Moving printing of the startup "banner" to a UI member
		function. (No banner is currently displayed for the GTKMM UI
		though, because it would feel too heavy-weight.)
		The ConsoleUI shows a "GXemul> " prompt, but does not support
		input yet.
20080101	Continuing on the ConsoleUI; it now reads input from stdin and
		sends it to a CommandInterpreter. Simple handling of CTRL-C,
		CTRL-Z, and treating DEL as backspace.
		Adding a Command base class, and adding the first command,
		which is "quit" :-).
		Simplifying the syntax of the UNITTEST macro.
20080102	Adding a section about GXemul being Free Software to intro.html
		(same as in previous versions of GXemul).
		Implementing CommandInterpreter::RunCommand, so that commands
		can be executed. "help", "quit", and "version" work
		interactively now :)
20080103	CTRL-A/E (for start/end of line) and CTRL-B/F (for back/
		forward cursor movement) now work in the console UI.
		Mapping ANSI/VTxxx/xterm cursor keys (escape + [ + misc) to
		CTRL-A/E/B/F/N/P.
		Adding command history support to the CommandInterpreter.
		Classes that perform unit tests using the UNITTESTS(classname)
		macro are now tested (almost) automagically by
		UnitTest::RunTests(). (.h files must still be included.)
20080104	Connecting cursor up/down keys to the command history.
		Adding Component::Clone. (Not really used yet.)
		Adding CTRL-D support to the command interpreter (remove
		character to the right).
		Actions will now be placed in src/main/actions/.
		Implementing an AddComponentAction.
20080105	Beginning on TAB completion in the CommandInterpreter.
		Implementing the UndoCommand and the RedoCommand.
		Adding CTRL-K (kill end of line) to the command interpreter.
		Implementing RemoveComponentAction.
20080106	Classes that use UNITTESTS(classname) are now fully auto
		tested, no need to manually include .h files anymore. (This
		relies on the fact that .h files have names that are exactly
		the same as the class name they represent, otherwise it would
		not work that well.) Updating some Doxygen comments to reflect
		the current state of automagic unit testing.
		Renaming TODO to doc/TODO.html.
		Changing the Doxyfile to include full .cc source code in
		the built documentation.
20080107	The "tree" command now shows a fancy ASCII tree of components.
		Beginning on the "add" command (AddComponentCommand).
		Components now get names based on their class name, followed
		by a zero-based increasing integer, e.g. dummy0, dummy1, etc.
		when added (if they don't already have a unique name).
20080108	TAB complete of empty string now shows all available commands.
		Implementing Component helpers: GeneratePath and LookupPath.
		The "add" command now takes path into account, but it must be
		a complete path from the root component (i.e. "root.blahblah").
		Component::Serialize now serializes into a std::stringstream
		instead of returning a plain string.
20080109	Implementing Component::FindPathByPartialMatch (helper func.).
		The "add" command now uses FindPathByPartialMatch for the
		where-to-add argument.
		Tab completion now expands component names :)  also using
		FindPathByPartialMatch. (Syntax of different parts of a
		command line are not taken into account yet, though, so it
		also for example tries to expand the argument of the "help"
		command as a component name.)
		Component::Serialize now serializes into an ostream instead
		of a stringstream.
		Implementing the "save" command.
		CTRL-T now runs a "status" command (not yet implemented),
		instead of using a status line hack of its own.
		Implementing ClearEmulationAction and LoadEmulationAction.
		Implementing the "close" and "load" commands.
20080110	Making the LoadEmulationAction undo-able (in the case the new
		component was added to the tree, and did not entierly
		replace the root component).
20080112	The gxemul binary can now be started with a config file as
		an argument, which causes it to be loaded. The default RunState
		is now Running on startup, and -V is used to set it to Paused.
		Adding a NullUI, so that the result of GXemul::GetUI() does
		not have to be checked all the time.
		Creating a ComponentFactory; moving Component::CreateComponent
		to ComponentFactory::CreateComponent.
		Reworking how components are created, in preparation for
		getting "templates" (such as the testmips machine) to work.
		A list of Components is now generated by the configure script,
		so that all .h files with a COMPONENT(name) command in
		src/include/components/ (including template machines, etc) will
		be creatable using ComponentFactory::CreateComponent.
		The -E command line option now works :-)
20080113	Adding a "quiet mode" to the GXemul class, set to true by the
		-q command line option.
		Adding some more simple commands: continue, list-components.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		(This is the 0.4.x branch.)
20080118	Applying a WDC patch from Oleksandr Tymoshenko (dev_wdc.c and
		bus_pci.c), fixing the order of 16-bit words within 32-bit
		words in the identify struct, and not clearing the error on
		reads from the error register anymore.

==============  RELEASE 0.4.6.2  ==============

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		(This is the C++ branch.)
20080119	Adding a generic GetAttribute function to components. Planned
		attributes are "template", "stable", "machine", "description",
		and "contributors". Unimplemented attributes result in an empty
		string being returned from GetAttribute.
		Moving the ASCII tree generator from TreeCommand.cc to
		Component::GenerateTreeDump.
		Documentation of available machine templates and all components
		is now automagically generated on a "make documentation".
		(doc/machines.html and doc/components.html.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		(This is the 0.4.x branch.)
20080120	Some minor OpenFirmware fixes: Adding a "memory" property to
		"/chosen", adding a dummy claim() service.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		(This is the C++ branch.)
20080120	Adding CTRL-W handling (remove current/last word) to the
		CommandInterpreter.
		The machines.html and components.html documentation pages now
		point to individual doc/machine_XXX.html and component_XXX.html
		pages, if they exist.
20080122	Beginning to rewrite the component state variable
		implementation a bit, in preparation for serialization/
		deserialization, undo/redo, and "run backwards" with data
		tightly tied to components.
20080123	Continuing on the state variable stuff. Both strings and
		integers (8-bit through 64-bit, signed and unsigned) can be
		used as state variables so far, but more unit tests are needed.
		Component classes can now also be registered runtime. (This is
		needed to enable meaningful unit testing of some things,
		such as cloning of dummy unit test components.)
20080124	Moving doc/machine_*.html and component_*.html into subdirs.
20080129	Re-adding detection of host arch (ABI) to the configure script.
20080203	Continuing on state variables (unit tests etc).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		(This is the 0.4.x branch.)
20080205	Switching order of DINCLUDE and XINCLUDE in
		src/devices/Makefile (thanks to Ning Zhao for the tip).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		(This is the C++ branch.)
20080210	Adding -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG_PEDANTIC to CFLAGS for
		debug builds.
20080222	Beginning on the main run loop, GXemul::ExecuteCycles.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		(This is the 0.4.x branch.)
20080222	Adding a DEV_DISK_OFFSET_HIGH32 register, for reading/writing
		the top 32 bits of the offset register (useful for emulated
		32-bit archs), as suggested by Julian Elischer.

==============  RELEASE 0.4.6.3  ==============

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		(This is the C++ branch.)
20080226	Implementing an IRInstruction base class, and some initial
		IR instructions (simple adds, moves, stores).
20080227	Continuing on IRInstruction stuff; unit tests to see that
		automatic native code generation kicks in, etc.
		Implementing a simple IRBlockCache, which is just a linear
		memory range with PROT_EXEC, which is reset when it overflows.
		Beginning on a (so far dummy) IRNativeAMD64 code generator.
		Adding a configure option for disabling native code generation
		support completely.
20080229	Rethinking how the IR stuff should work: I'll probably use
		simple and traditional interpretation by default (read instr,
		decode, execute), and only let native code generation via some
		form of IR kick in when necessary. Two advantages: it will be
		easier to add new cpu types (because an interpretation switch/
		case block is very easy to understand), and there will be no
		waste of memory (for IR data) for code which is not commonly
		used.
		Removing IRBlock and IRInstruction, but keeping IRBlockCache
		and IRNativeAMD64 for later.
		The IRBlockCache can now be resized during runtime (and it
		expands automatically if necessary).
20080314	Working on the main loop, GXemul::ExecuteCycles(), which should
		call each component's Run function in suitable proportions.
		Adding a CPUComponent base class, from which MIPS_CPUComponent
		inherits.
20080316	Switching from CVS to SVN.
		Adding a test to the configure script for the "-ansi" compiler
		option; implementing a simple parse_number to replace strtoull
		to make everything build with -ansi. Various minor fixes to
		make -ansi work on a Debian GNU/Linux system (using CXXFLAGS
		instead of CFLAGS in Makefiles, and probe MAP_ANON in the
		configure script using $CXX, not $CC).
		Moving NativeTranslationExists and LookupCurrentCodePage from
		MIPS_CPUComponent to CPUComponent; these are intended to be
		used from most CPU components.
		Removing lots of "cd .." stuff from the Makefiles; GNU make
		did not work too well with them. Hopefully this will make
		tracking down compile problems on GNU/Linux machines easier.
20080317	Beginning on an AddressDataBus abstract class/interface, which
		e.g. the RAM component will implement.
20080320	Continuing on the RAMComponent class.
20080321	"make install" now installs .desktop and icon files.
		More work on the RAMComponent class: endianness for loads and
		stores larger than 8 bits, some simple unit tests.
20080322	Adding a preliminary toolbar to the GTKMM GUI.
		Upgrading configure script check for gtkmm-2.4 from version
		2.12.1 to 2.12.5. (Maybe not stricly necessary, but that's what
		I am currently using for development.)
20080323	Experimenting with graying out the Undo and Redo actions in
		the GUI (by querying the ActionStack).
20080324	Making the code compile cleanly with GNU C++' -pedantic. The
		only module where -pedantic is not used is src/ir/, which needs
		to cast e.g. uint8_t* to function pointer (for runtime
		generated code).
		Beginning on a mainbus (MainbusComponent), which will forward
		reads and writes to other devices (such as RAM).
20080325	Making the counter in the ReferenceCountable class mutable,
		because const objects also need to be reference countable.
		Attempting to fix a bug related to the integer types passed
		to UnitTest::Assert. (Problem noticed by Hollis Blanchard.)
		Fixing arguments to and return handling of mmap(). (Also
		noticed by Hollis.)
20080328	Making everything build using SunStudio (Sun C++ 5.9).
		Implementing support for Double state variables.
		CPU speed is now a state variable, in CPUComponent.
		Cleaning up the CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS/COPTIM/CWARNINGS mess in the
		configure script and Makefile.skel files; only CXXFLAGS (and
		CXXFLAGSBASE) are used from now on. Also removing some other
		unused legacy stuff from the configure script.
20080329	Minor fixes to make the source code build with a 20080321
		snapshot of GCC 4.4.
20080330	Continuing on the GTKMM GUI (File->Open/Save/Save As show
		file chooser dialogs, and Edit->Undo/Redo execute the "undo"
		and "redo" commands). "File->New from Blank" and "Go/Continue"
		also have bare-bones implementations.
		Continuing on mainbus related things; moving the mips_cpu in
		the testmips machine so that it is placed on the mainbus.
		Adding a MemoryMappedComponent base class, which all memory-
		mapped components should inherit. (The canonical example is
		the RAMComponent class.)
		The mainbus can now forward reads and writes to memory-mapped
		child components.
20080401	Continuing on the mainbus (writing unit tests).
		Reintroduce the 'bool' state variable type.
		Adding a 'writeProtected' state bool for the RAMComponent, to
		emulate ROM behavior in a simple way.
20080402	Creating a src/include/thirdparty directory. Moving debug_new.h
		etc there. Also importing exec_elf.h from NetBSD [HEAD], and
		updating doc/RELEASE.html to reflect the location of thirdparty
		imports.
		Implementing the initial framework for I18N/localization. The
		first translation is Swedish. :-)
20080404	Making it possible to build with GTKMM 2.15.5 with --debug;
		note, however, that this produces memory leak warnings, so
		the GTKMM with --debug combination is not very useful yet.
		Implementing basic support for updating the UI when some things
		change: Undo/Redo-applicability, the name of the emulation, and
		the RunState. (As UI::UpdateUI().)
		Removing all old CVS $Id$ tags; they are not useful anymore.
		The GTKMM GUI EmulationDesignArea now shows some dummy circles
		(one for each component in the emulation setup).
20080405	Beginning on a FileLoader class, for loading binaries (e.g.
		ELFs). Also adding a test/ directory, where small test files
		used for unit tests may be stored. ELF program segments are
		loaded, but no additional information yet (entry point etc.).
		Catching std::exception at the outermost level, in order to
		print a reasonable message if the application crashes.
		Instead of loading binaries into an AddressDataBus, they are
		now loaded into a Component, which, if it has a "pc" state
		variable, is set to the entry point. Starting gxemul with
		-E testmips test/FileLoader_ELF_MIPS actually attempts to
		start running the binary now :-)
		Some more work on the GTKMM GUI: the debug output window now
		shows debug messages and commands being executed.
20080406	Adding a section about Model-View-Controller to the source
		code documentation main page, and a simple picture of what the
		component tree may look like.
		Introducing "visible class names" in addition to the normal
		class name, for components. This makes mips_cpu0 show up as
		just cpu0, which is much nicer.
		uint16_t, 32_t, and 64_t state variables are now outputted in
		hexadecimal form in ToString(), for readability.
		The ListComponents command now shows the short description of
		each command.
		Links are now generated from component names in machines.html
		to corresponding component_xxx.html pages.
		Beginning on internal support for instruction disassembly (not
		user-accessible yet).
20080407	Continuing on the instruction disassembly stuff; importing
		some MIPS defines from GXemul 0.4.6.3.
20080409	Implementing support in the CommandInterpreter for running
		methods on components. If a component name is "executed" with
		no method name given, the component tree is dumped. (This means
		that there is no need for the 'tree' command anymore, so it
		has been removed.)
		Implementing the first component method: "unassemble" for the
		CPUComponent.
		GTKMM GUI test: Connecting to the "activate" signal of a text
		entry, so that commands are executed once ENTER is pressed;
		this does not work with tab-completion and command line
		editing though, since only ENTER is signaled.
20080410	CPUComponent's unassemble method now remembers where it last
		unassembled, and starts at m_pc if it is the first time it
		is executed.
		Porting more MIPS-related code from GXemul 0.4.6.3; some
		more instructions can be disassembled now.
20080412	Implementing tab-completion of methods on components.
		Executing a component name without any method name, which
		results in the component tree being dumped, will now also
		dump all of the component's state variables.
		Continuing on porting GXemul 0.4.6.3's MIPS disassembly code.
		The GTKMM GUI can now be shut down by the "quit" command.
20080413	Introducing a new RunState (NotRunning). Making the GTKMM GUI
		Run/Pause buttons stay down while in the Running/Paused
		runstates. (Also making the icons smaller by not showing text
		labels, and enabling tooltips instead. Looks/feels nicer.)
		Implementing an undoable ResetAction.
20080416	GUI updates: Fixed-width font in the debug console, and it
		now scrolls to bottom on text output.
20080419	AddComponentAction must not remember component references
		(for undo/redo); instead it now remember paths.
		Also implementing a similar fix for RemoveComponentAction.
20080423	Action::Execute and Undo are now private, and only reachable
		from the ActionStack (now a friend class of Action).
20080424	Upgrading configure script check for gtkmm-2.4 from version
		2.12.5 to 2.12.7, to be in synch with my system.
20080426	The continue command now clears the Undo stack.
		State variable names of components can now be tab completed.
		"Running" a variable (e.g. cpu0.pc) will print its value.
20080427	Continuing a little on tab completion of variable names.
		Implementing a "dirty flag" for the emulation; the GTKMM GUI
		now asks for confirmation before quitting, opening a new
		emulation, etc, if the model is dirty.
20080501	Fixing LoadComponentAction so that it uses path names for
		Undo, and not reference pointers to components.
		Fixing a crash bug in CommandInterpreter when tab completing
		non-existant component names.
		Implementing a VariableAssignmentAction. No expressions yet,
		only simple values (numeric, strings, and boolean values).
20080531	Refactoring the Component::AddVariable* functions into a
		single template function.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		(This is the 0.4.x branch.)
20080605	Fixing a corner case in ARM pc-relative loads, which was
		unimplemented before. (Triggered by doing builds of pkgsrc
		stuff inside emulated NetBSD/cats.)
20080610	Applying a patch from Jiri Svoboda, which implements the
		ARM "bkpt" instruction.

==============  RELEASE 0.4.6.4  ==============

20080611	Correcting the ARM pc-relative load fix; the wrong address
		variable was used. Also, the pc-relative _load_ code was
		used for stores as well, which was completely incorrect.
		On ARM, since pc-relative loads are converted into immediate
		movs, on writes to pages that contain such translations, the
		ENTIRE page must be invalidated, not just the 1/32th that
		was code. This has now been implemented.

==============  RELEASE 0.4.6.5  ==============

20080808	Applying a patch from Kiyotaka Inaba which causes an ARM UND
		exception to be generated by the instruction word 0xe6000011,
		which is needed by gdb when running inside the emulator.
		Also enabling ARM UND exceptions for ARM floating point
		instructions (needed by both Linux and NetBSD/arm).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		(This is the C++ branch.)
20080810	Implementing a basic Trigger framework.
20080812	Continuing on Triggers; it's now possible to use static
		member functions as callback functions. Beginning to connect
		triggers to the GTKMM GUI.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		(This is the 0.4.x branch.)
20081103	Fix for a free() bug in bootblock_iso9660.c.
		Updating the OpenBSD/landisk installation instructions from
		4.2 to 4.4, after verifying that it works.
20081104	NOTE: I'm throwing away the C++ rewrite attempt ("0.5.x"),
		moving back gxemul-legacy to gxemul/trunk. The old C++
		rewrite attempt is archived under gxemul/branches/.
20081109	Updating most NetBSD 4.0 install instructions to 4.0.1.

==============  RELEASE 0.4.6.6  ==============

20081114	Adding the M88K 'add' instruction for immediate values
		(add_imm in cpu_m88k_instr.c).
		Continuing on dev_pcc2 (used by mvme187).
		Working on M88K interrupts. Very unstable so far; OpenBSD/
		mvme88k bugs out randomly after the first few interrupts.
20081115	More work on dev_pcc2.
		Found the "random" failure bug: the M88K interrupt handling
		code didn't execute the interrupted instruction, but skipped
		it instead.
		Fixing a bug in the implementation of the m88k 'ext'
		instruction (it worked like extu!).
		Adding disassembly of all 88100 floating point instructions.
		Minor updates to make the code build with GCC "4.4.0 20081017".
20081116	Implementing the m88k flt.ss, flt.ds, trnc.ss, trnc.sd, and
		fadd.dds floating point instructions.
20081121	Updating the HelenOS version in the documentation to 0.3.0.
		Continuing on 88100 interrupt/exception handling.
20081125	Bringing back the dummy machine_iyonix.c, which was removed
		in SVN rev. 4866.
		Fixing a bug in ARM pc-relative loads, when loading within
		the same page as the pc.
20081126	Continuing on the Iyonix mode: connecting initial i80321
		interrupts, and importing NetBSD/iyonix' bootconfig.h.
20081127	Importing iopi2creg.h from NetBSD (ARM Xscale I2C registers).
		Implementing the SH4 fsrra instruction, 1/sqrt(x), and the
		fipr instruction (vector dot-product).
20081203	Using register names in dev_clmpcc, but no actual progress on
		getting OpenBSD/mvme88k to boot further.
		FINALLY found the M88K bug I've been hunting: conditional
		branches with delay slots did not set the delay target address
		correctly in the case the branch was _not_ taken.
20081204	Interrupt exceptions (in cpu_dyntrans.c) are no longer
		generated while single-stepping. (It was too annoying.)
20081206	Implementing rudimentary tx/rx interrupts for clmpcc;
		OpenBSD/mvme88k can input/output stuff in userland now :)
		Implementing the "max negative number" condition of the
		M88K bcnd instruction.
		Implementing the M88K triadic register 'rot' instruction.
		The FIP != NIP+4 situation in the M88K rte instruction is now
		supported (i.e. executing one instruction from the pipeline,
		and then continuing somewhere else).
		Continuing on Dreamcast PowerVR register names, etc.
20081208	Beginning on a osiop (NCR 53C710 SCSI) device skeleton.
20081210	The SH4 Store Queue memory area is 0x04000000 long, not 0x40.
20081211	OpenBSD/m88k's badaddr() should now be able to detect
		invalid addresses; memory_rw.c causes exceptions on reads
		that fail (but no actual address is supplied yet).
20081212	Moving the Dreamcast PowerVR2 DMA handling from
		dev_dreamcast_g2 to dev_pvr, where it belongs.
20081213	Continuing on SH4 and PowerVR2 DMA.
		Moving the unsupported guest OSes from guestoses.html to a
		new page, unsupported.html, for clarity.
		Continuing on the NCR 53C710 SCSI controller (dev_osiop.c).
20081217	Beginning on implementing the SCRIPTS instruction set for
		dev_osiop.
20081219	Continuing a little bit on the osiop SCRIPTS ISA.
20081221	Implementing an instruction combination for M88K idle loop
		detection (works with OpenBSD/mvme88k).
		Adding a dummy LUNA 88K machine mode (machine_luna88k.c).
20081229	Continuing on the osiop SCRIPTS ISA.
20081231	More progress on dev_osiop.c.
20090101	FINALLY the osiop works well enough to let OpenBSD detect
		SCSI devices! :-)
		After some more hacking, everything is finally stable enough
		to allow OpenBSD/mvme88k to be installed onto a disk image!
20090102	Optimizing the osiop SCSI device a bit; a default scripted
		install of OpenBSD/mvme88k has dropped from 30 minutes to 10.
		Fixing a bug which was caused by instructions like subu.co
		with a destination register of r0 being treated as nop.
		Various updates to make the source code build better on
		Linux (Ubuntu 8.10), and with GNU make.

==============  RELEASE 0.4.7  ==============

20090103	Merging fixes from the main trunk.
20090122	Merging in fdiv.sss and fadd.dsd from the main trunk.
20090123	NetBSD/hpcmips can now be installed and run using serial
		console (i.e. without -X), in addition to using the
		framebuffer.

==============  RELEASE 0.4.7.1  ==============

20090215	Updating the guest OS page for HelenOS 0.4.0.
20090513	Fixing the MIPS tne, teq, tge, tgeu, tlt, and tltu instructions
		to allow non-zero "code" values.
		Adding a new Linux/Malta "variant 2" entry to the unsupported
		guest OS page.
20090518	Changing the 8253 interrupt mechanism to assert interrupts
		regardless of "mode" bits, causing Linux/Malta to get further.
		Hacking on piix4 a bit to attempt to please Linux/Malta;
		interrupts are lost.
20090610	Making configuration files work again! (Thanks to Wu Kan for
		noticing this bug.)
20090611	Documentation updates (NetBSD 5 etc).
20090621	Adding a hack for the pcc2 PSCALEADJ register, making it
		possible to install and run OpenBSD/mvme88k 4.5.
		NetBSD/evbmips, /sgimips, and /cobalt 5.0 have been verified
		to work.

==============  RELEASE 0.4.7.2  ==============

20090626	Attempting to switch from C to C++ (_WITHOUT_ starting over
		from scratch). Step 1: Rename all .c files to .cc. 2. Rename
		all occurances of 'template' and 'class' to other things.
		Step 3: Fix malloc/realloc cast errors.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
		NOTE: From here on, stuff was merged piece by piece from the
		experimental C++ branch to the trunk; only the trunk is used
		from this point.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
20090627	Continuing on the C to C++ switch.
		Updating the OpenBSD/mvme88k regression test expect script
		from 4.4 to 4.5.
		Everything now builds with "make -j X".
20090628	Moving src/*.cc into a new directory, src/main/.
		Finally adding the "make install" target (again).
		Moving TODO and RELEASE notes to doc/.
		Adding Doxygen documentation generation (again).
20090703	Moving more C++ code from the old branch into the main trunk.
		(UnitTest, Component*, StateVariable, debug_new, ...)
		Removing bogus/unfinished archs (Alpha, SPARC, M32R) and
		the skeleton "userland emulation".
20090704	Moving thirdparty includes into src/include/thirdparty/.
20090705	Beginning to import various Components from the experimental
		C++ branch (starting with the MVME187Machine).
		Removing more bogus/unfinished code: Bebox and Luna88k.
		Attempting to move in more code from the experimental C++
		branch: the GXemul main class, command interpreter and related
		commands, file loader, UIs, etc.
20090710	Moving in more code.
		Added a note in guestoses.html that all current modes are
		legacy modes, using the old framework.
		Updating the OpenBSD/landisk regression test expect script
		from 4.1 to 4.5.
		Attempting to connect -V and -e so that the new framework is
		used for new template machines.
		Making everything build on Linux (missing includes etc.).
		Removing all $CC stuff from configure (only $CXX remains).
		Merging in the automated component and machine HTML
		documentation stuff from the C++ branch.
		Applying a patch from Izumi Tsutsui which makes NetBSD/hpcmips
		work well with the clock again.
20090711	Applying another patch from Izumi Tsutsui, for setting the
		ARCBIOS OSLOADPARTITION environment variable in a more correct
		way. (Also updating the guest OS page for NetBSD/arc 5.0.)
		Updating the NetBSD/pmax regression test expect scripts from
		3.1 to 5.0 (for both R3000 and R4400).
		Moving regression test expect scripts to the test/ directory.
		Creating a regression test expect script for NetBSD/arc 5.0.
20090712	Adding a dummy "testm88k" machine for the new framework.
		Updating the install instructions for NetBSD/cobalt to use the
		RAMDISK installer (thanks to Izumi Tsutsui for noticing).
20090713	Beginning on an a.out FileLoader for the new framework.
20090714	Continuing on the a.out FileLoader.
20090716	a.out (big-endian only so far) can now be loaded into
		AddressDataBus objects.
		Modifying the "load" command so that it can load both component
		trees _and_ other binaries (ELFs etc) into components.
		Merging in a lot of TODO entries from the old C++ branch's TODO
		file.
20090717	Implementing the 'move' command for moving components.
		Removing the 'dirty flag' concept (it wasn't really used).
		Adding a .dump method to the RAMComponent, for dumping raw
		(physical) memory contents.
		Adding a similar .dump method to the CPUComponent, for dumping
		the virtual memory space. (Note that this can have side
		effects, when reading from devices...)
		Implementing the 'copy' command, for cloning components.
20090718	Updating the man page to reflect new command line options vs
		legacy options.
		Adding a .registers method to the CPUComponent for dumping CPU
		registers; implementing specifics for MIPS and M88K.
		Enabling simple variable assignment [again].
		Implementing (in a ugly hack-ish way) serialization support
		for the RAM component, using a "custom" StateVariable type.
		Beginning to implement a "pre run check" mechanism.
20090720	Implementing PreRunCheck for CPU components (they need to have
		an address/data bus, either as a child or as a parent, to run).
20090721	Implementing PreRunCheck for MainBusComponent.
		At startup, a suitable part of the component tree is now shown.
		Adding a GenerateShortestPossiblePath method on Component.
		Adding a helper for outputting pre-0.6.0 style debug messages
		from components ("[ componentname: message ]").
		Tab completion (in the CommandInterpreter) now uses shortest
		path, whenever possible, instead of full paths.
20090722	Implementing a new concept of "on reset commands"; beginning on
		extending the ELF loader for symbol loading support.
20090723	Moving 'step' and 'time' concepts from the GXemul class to a
		new component, the RootComponent.
		Minor configure script fixes (allow --without-unittests etc.).
		Removing the "NotRunning" run state.
		Adding dummy "step", "backward-step", and "continue-backwards"
		commands.
		Implementing support for re-executing commands without args
		("step" and "backward-step" so far).
20090724	The CPUComponent's .unassemble and .dump methods, and the
		RAMComponent's .dump method, are now also re-executable.
		CPU endianness is now serialized (as a bool, not enum).
		Beginning to work on cycle execution!
20090725	The step command now takes an argument (default is 1).
20090726	Removing the "global time" concept.
		Adding a helper for debug message indentation.
		Adding an "accuracy" variable to the RootComponent, which must
		be set to either "cycle" or "sloppy".
		Implementing pre-run-checks for M88K and MIPS cpus, for
		checking the r0 and zr registers, respectively.
20090727	When single-stepping, all state change (except for Custom
		StateVariables such as RAM contents) is now displayed.
		Porting the 88100 disassembly code from the old implementation
		to the new.
		Moving old main files into src/old_main/ (for clarity).
20090728	Including screenshots in auto generated machines.html.
		Finally managed to implement cycle-accurate continuous
		execution of multiple components at different speeds. :-)
		RAMComponent now clears ram on reset.
		Implementing a symbol registry for the new framework (which
		is per CPU).
20090729	Slowly beginning to reimplement dyntrans in C++: Beginning on
		the CPUComponent::DyntransExecute core loop, and some
		basic structures. MIPS and M88K cpus call DyntransExecute.
20090731	Continuing on the new dyntrans core. The first instruction (a
		M88K subu) can be executed on a dummy IC page.
		[Re]implementing some simple MIPS and M88K instructions.
		Arguments can now be passed during component creation, e.g.
		nr CPUs, CPU model, or ram amount for a template machine.
		Adding a 'raw' file loader, and a dummy SGI IP32 template.
20090801	Two MIPS16 instructions can be disassembled; disassembly
		address is now not necessarily the same as m_pc (e.g. on
		MIPS16, the lowest bit is cleared).
		Beginning on implementing branches: the MIPS "b" instruction,
		with delay slot (both continuous execution, and single-stepping
		with pause in the middle of the branch, etc).
		Continuing on the dyntrans core loop (inlined instruction calls
		first, then run a few remaining calls).
20090802	Implementing a skeleton implementation for the backward-step
		command (but since variable write handlers aren't implemented
		yet, it doesn't really work).
		Updating the Introduction chapter in the documentation with
		a section about the New framework.
		Beginning on M88K bsr and jmp.n instruction implementations,
		function call trace support, etc.
20090803	Continuing on function call trace support.
20090804	Using anonymous unions and ptrdiff_t, to avoid overloading
		pointers and size_t members unsafely, and other size_t usage.
		(Thanks to Weinholt for commenting on this.)
20090807	Getting rid of the last 'delete' call (in MainbusComponent,
		there was a _pointer_ to a memory map, instead of just a
		memory map). The new GXemul framework is thus completely free
		of malloc/free and manual delete. (mmap/munmap are, for natural
		reasons, used though by the RAMComponent.)
		Separating out the dyntrans specific parts of CPUComponent into
		another base class, CPUDyntransComponent, so that it in theory
		is possible to implement non-dyntrans CPUs.
		Partial support for choosing MIPS ABI (affects disassembly and
		register dumps, mostly).
20090810	Beginning on variable write handlers: MIPS zr register is
		read-only, MIPS' model can now be changed correctly, and
		root.accuracy can only be assigned "cycle" or "sloppy".
20090814	Continuing on write handlers for variables (root.step),
		beginning on component tree snapshotting (using Clone). The
		backward-step command now works reasonably well (but the only
		snapshot taken so far is at step=0).
20090815	Reimplementing the M88K br, or_imm, or.u_imm, cmp, cmp_imm,
		and_imm, and.u_imm, mask_imm, mask.u_imm, mak, mak_imm,
		mulu_imm, xor_imm, and xor.u_imm instructions.
20090819	Base OTHERLIBS in configure on LDFLAGS.
20090821	Updating the TODO with thoughts/plans for the "plugin" part
		of the new framework.
20090822	Beginning on a doc/framework.html, describing the new
		framework concepts to end-users.
20090905	Continuing on the dyntrans core: page allocation.
20091207	The dev_ether MAC address can now be read.
20091212	Updating the OpenBSD/landisk install instructions in
		guestoses.html from OpenBSD 4.5 to 4.6.
20091219	Include _GLIBCXX_DEBUG and _GLIBCXX_DEBUG_PEDANTIC defines in
		debug builds, to potentially catch some STL misuses.
		If valgrind is found by the configure script, it is used when
		running 'make test'. If there is any output from valgrind -q
		(i.e. errors), then make test fails.
20100127	Patch from Tassilo Philipp to enable PPC's fabs instruction.
		Patch from Yana to use return value from net_ethernet_rx()
		correctly in dev_ether.c.
20100128	Adding a check (for "make test") to see that delete isn't
		used. Only a few exceptions are allowed.
20100129	Reimplementing the (non-specialized) M88K bsr instruction.
		Continuing on the dyntrans core: page allocation. The basics
		(page allocation and LRU deallocation) have been implemented,
		but not really tested in practice yet.
20100130	Reimplementing the M88K ldcr instruction, and a slow version
		of the st instruction (store 32-bit word).
		Updating guest OS documentation (NetBSD/landisk 4.0.1 to
		5.0.1, NetBSD/pmax 5.0 to 5.0.1, NetBSD/arc 5.0 to 5.0.1,
		NetBSD/cobalt 5.0 to 5.0.1).
		Renaming old testmips to oldtestmips, so that the name
		testmips can be used by the new framework.
20100131	Reimplementing a slow version of the st.d M88K instruction.
		"Quiet mode" is now turned off, if dropping into the debugger,
		both by using -V and by triggering unimplemented instructions.
		The m88k_cpu now takes a creation argument called r31, for the
		initial stack pointer value. (Needed to run the rectangle
		drawing demo, which assumes a valid r31 on startup.)
		Reimplementing the M88K bsr.n instruction, including single-
		stepping scenarios.
20100202	Reimplementing generic M88K loads/stores using templates. (In
		the old implementation, these were constructed using build-
		time generated define/include magic to simulate a template-
		style mechanism in C).
		Reimplementing the M88K divu d,s1,imm instruction.
		Reimplementing the M88K lda.* instruction.
20100203	Beginning on reimplementing M88K bb0.n and bb1.n; only the
		non-singlestepping variant done so far.
20100204	bb0.n and bb1.n should now also work when single-stepping.
		Implementing the non-singlestep variant of M88K jmp.n.
		Beginning on the M88K bcnd.n instruction.
20100205	Continuing on bcnd.n. The testm88k rectangle drawing demo
		now runs :) both when running continuously, and when
		single-stepping. (No graphical output yet, of course.)
20100206	Reimplementing the M88K ext and extu instructions.
		Reimplementing the M88K bb0 and bb1 non-delayslot
		instructions, including samepage variants.
		Reimplementing the M88K stcr, jmp, and tb0 and tb1
		instructions.
		Fixing a bug in the MRU list in DyntransTranslationCache.
		Fixing disassembly of tb0 and tb1, and implementing the
		rest of the bcnd conditions.
		Beginning on reimplementing MIPS (slow) loads/stores,
		and reimplementing the MIPS addu, subu, srl, xor, multu,
		mfhi, mflo, mthi, and mtlo instructions.
20100207	Reimplementing the MIPS slt and sltu instructions, various
		branch instructions, and fixing some bugs; the rectangle
		drawing demo for testmips runs in the new framework :)
		Switching function call trace on/off during runtime now
		clears [individual] translation pages.
20100213	Working on dyntrans abort peculiarities (in the middle of
		delay-slots, etc).
20100214	Preparing for a quick 0.6.0 release.
